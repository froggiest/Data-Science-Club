Increase to medium-high speed and continue beating until pale and fluffy, about 1 minute.
Reduce to medium-speed, then add in the egg, and egg yolks, beating until well combined, and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla.
On low speed, gradually add in the flour and salt, and beat until combined. Your dough should be stiff.
Sprinkle 2 Tablespoons of flour on a clean work surface. Scrape the cookie dough onto the surface and gently knead for 30 seconds. Divide the dough in half, (443 grams each disc). Press each portion of cookie dough into a 6”-inch disc. 
Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours (or up to 2 days).
When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Working with one disc at a time, unwrap the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the disc out to ¼” thickness. Then use cookie cutters to cut out as many shapes as you can. 
Carefully transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheet, leaving 1” between cookies. Bake for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 15 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. Any dough scraps can be chilled and carefully rolled out again. 
Once the cookies are cool, glaze and decorate! 
In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and milk until well combined. You’re looking for a thick but pourable consistency. 
Dip the top of a fully cooled cookie into the glaze, allowing excess glaze to drip back into the bowl before transferring it to a cooling rack. 
Sprinkle with crushed candy canes, nuts, or sprinkles. Repeat with as many cookies as desired. Allow the glaze to set for at least 1 hour before serving. 
Melt the chopped chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave. If using the microwave method, place the chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Melt in the microwave, on low power, in 15 second increments, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth.
Dip the cookies halfway into the melted chocolate, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl, before transferring it to a cooling rack. Sprinkle with crushed candy canes, nuts, or sprinkles. Repeat with as many cookies as desired. You can also dip the top fully in chocolate for a different look.
Allow the chocolate to fully set before serving, about 1 hour. 
At step 4, roll each portion of dough into a log that’s roughly 2”-inches in diameter. 
Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours (or up to 2 days). 
Use a sharp knife to slice the logs of cookie dough into 1/4"" rounds. Place the cookies 1/2"" apart on the prepared baking sheet, and bake at 350 for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Cool for 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Dip half of each cookie in the chocolate coating, if desired, and sprinkle with candy, sprinkles, or nuts.
After making the dough, use a small spring loaded spoon to scoop out a heaping Tablespoon (about 30 grams) of the dough. Roll it into a ball and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with all dough, leaving 2-inches between each cookie for spreading. 
Use your thumb to make an indentation in the center of each cookie and bake for 10 minutes. 
Remove from the oven and fill each indentation with a teaspoon of jam, then bake for 5 more minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Cool for at least 1 hour on the baking sheet before serving. 
Follow instructions for slice and bake cookies, but roll the dough out slightly thinner, getting it to ⅛” thickness. Use round or scalloped round cookie cutters to cut out an even amount of rounds. 
Carefully transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheet, leaving 1” between cookies. Bake for 8 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 30 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.
