Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large (18- by 12-inch) baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk together 1¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour and ½ teaspoon baking soda in medium bowl; set aside.
Heat 10 tablespoons unsalted butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat and use heatproof spatula to transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons unsalted butter into hot butter until completely melted.
Add ½ cup granulated sugar, ¾ cup packed dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon table salt, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract to bowl with butter and whisk until fully incorporated.
Add 1 large egg and 1 large egg yolk and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny.
Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute.Stir in 1¼ cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks and ¾ cup toasted and chopped pecans or walnuts, if using. Give dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.
Divide dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (or use #24 cookie scoop). Arrange 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets, 8 dough balls per sheet. (Smaller baking sheets can be used, but will require 3 batches.)
Bake cookies 1 tray at a time until cookies are golden brown and still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 10 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.
Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool cookies completely before serving.

Whisk 1½ cups (7½ ounces) all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon baking powder, and ¼ teaspoon baking soda together in medium bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat 12 tablespoons softened unsalted butter,¾ cup (5¼ ounces) light brown sugar, and ½ cup (3½ ounces) granulated sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add ⅔ cup creamy peanut butter and ⅓ cup red miso and beat on medium speed until well incorporated, about 1 minute.
Scrape down bowl, then add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla and mix until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and slowly add flour mixture until combined, about 30 seconds. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine ¼ cup unsalted peanuts, finely chopped, and ¼ cup black or white sesame seeds in bowl. Divide dough into 18 equal portions, about 3 tablespoons each, and roll into balls. Working with 1 ball at a time, drop into peanut mixture and press lightly into mixture to coat 1 side of each dough ball. Transfer to prepared baking sheets, peanut mixture side up, spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies 1 sheet at a time, storing second sheet in refrigerator, until edges are just set and beginning to brown, about 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely. Serve.

Microwave 6 ounces (170 grams) chocolate, oil, and butter in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring halfway through microwaving, until melted, about 3 minutes. Whisk milk into chocolate mixture until combined.
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip sugar and eggs on medium-high speed until very thick and pale, about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from mixer. Add melted chocolate mixture and whisk by hand until uniform. Fold in flour mixture with rubber spatula until thoroughly combined and no dry pockets remain. Fold in remaining 4 ounces (113 grams) chocolate.
Using 1-tablespoon measure or #30 scoop, scoop 10 heaping-tablespoon portions of batter onto each prepared sheet (you should have 20 cookies total). (Use soupspoon to help scrape batter from tablespoon, if necessary.) Bake until cookies are puffed and covered with large cracks (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), about 16 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking.

Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add sugar and salt; beat at medium-low speed until most of sugar is moistened, about 45 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds; scrape down bowl. Add heavy cream and vanilla and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice during mixing.
Meanwhile, grind raspberries in spice grinder until reduced to fine powder. Sift powder through fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon powder to buttercream and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add more raspberry powder to taste, as desired. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip. (Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.)
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe about 2 teaspoons filling on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Whisk egg, vanilla, salt, and almond extract together in small bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in second bowl.
Process sugar in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add butter and process until uniform mass forms and no large pieces of butter are visible, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add egg mixture and process until smooth and paste-like, about 10 seconds. Add flour mixture and process until no dry flour remains but mixture remains crumbly, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Turn out dough onto counter and knead gently by hand until smooth, about 10 seconds. Divide dough in half. Place 1 piece of dough in center of large sheet of parchment paper and press into 7 by 9-inch oval. Place second large sheet of parchment over dough and roll dough into 10 by 14-inch oval of even 1/8-inch thickness. Transfer dough with parchment to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat pressing and rolling with second piece of dough, then stack on top of first piece on sheet. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1½ hours (or freeze for 30 minutes). (Rolled dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line rimless cookie sheet with parchment. Working with 1 piece of rolled dough, gently peel off top layer of parchment. Replace parchment, loosely covering dough. (Peeling off parchment and returning it will make cutting and removing cookies easier.) Turn over dough and parchment and gently peel off and discard second piece of parchment. Using cookie cutter, cut dough into shapes. Transfer shapes to prepared cookie sheet, spacing them about ½ inch apart. Bake until cookies are lightly and evenly browned around edges, 14 to 17 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat cutting and baking with remaining dough. (Dough scraps can be patted together, rerolled, and chilled once before cutting and baking.)
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip all ingredients on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.
Spread icing onto cooled cookies. Let icing dry completely, about 1½ hours, before serving.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Using ruler and pencil, draw two 8 by 3-inch rectangles, spaced 4 inches apart, on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, ink side down.
Pulse 1 cup almonds in food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl and set aside. Process remaining 1/4 cup almonds in food processor until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour, baking powder, and salt; process to combine, about 15 seconds. Transfer flour mixture to second bowl. Process 2 eggs in now empty food processor until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter, almond extract, and vanilla and process until combined, about 10 seconds. Transfer egg mixture to medium bowl. Sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg mixture and, using spatula, gently fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and chopped almonds and gently fold until just combined.
Divide batter in half. Using floured hands, form each half into 8 by 3-inch rectangle, using lines on parchment as guide. Spray each loaf lightly with oil spray. Using rubber spatula lightly coated with oil spray, smooth tops and sides of rectangles. Gently brush tops of loaves with egg white wash. Bake until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.
Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes. Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Lay slices, cut side down, about 1/4 inch apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking.

 Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside. Process oats and raisins in food processor until very finely ground, about 1 minute.
 Whisk brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, melted butter, molasses, and cinnamon in large bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg and yolk and vanilla until smooth. Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir in flour mixture until evenly combined and no dry flour remains. Stir in oat-raisin mixture until evenly distributed. (Mixture will be stiff; once dough begins to stiffen, you can mix with your hands until dough is evenly combined.)
Divide dough into twenty-four 1⅓-ounce (38-gram) portions, about 1½ tablespoons each. Roll dough portions between your hands to form smooth balls. Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 12 balls per sheet. Using your hand or bottom of dry measuring cup, flatten balls to 2½-inch-wide disks.
 Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until tops are beginning to crack at edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.
 Process all ingredients in now-empty processor until smooth and fluffy, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer to bowl and stir to incorporate any dry sugar.

Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons butter into hot butter to melt; set aside for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 large (18 by 12-inch) baking sheets with parchment paper. In shallow baking dish or pie plate, mix granulated sugar and 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, rubbing between fingers, until well combined; set aside. Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder together in medium bowl; set aside.
Add remaining 1 3/4 cups brown sugar and salt to bowl with cooled butter; mix until no sugar lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula; add egg, yolk, and vanilla and mix until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Add flour mixture and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Give dough final stir with rubber spatula to ensure that no flour pockets remain and ingredients are evenly distributed.
Divide dough into 24 portions, each about 2 tablespoons, rolling between hands into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Working in batches, toss balls in reserved sugar mixture to coat and set on prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart, 12 dough balls per sheet. (Smaller baking sheets can be used, but it will take 3 batches.)
Bake one sheet at a time until cookies are browned and still puffy and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone; see photo below), 12 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Do not overbake.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Line bottom of 8-inch square baking pan with parchment. Process hazelnuts, flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until hazelnuts are very finely ground, 20 to 25 seconds. Add butter and pulse until dough just comes together, 20 to 25 pulses.
Transfer dough to counter, knead briefly to form smooth ball, place in prepared pan, and press into even layer that covers bottom of pan. Freeze for 10 minutes. Run knife or bench scraper between dough and edge of pan to loosen. Turn out dough onto counter and discard parchment. Cut dough into 64 squares (8 rows by 8 rows). Roll dough squares into balls and evenly space 32 dough balls on each prepared sheet. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until cookies look dry and are fragrant (cookies will settle but not spread), about 20 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let cookies cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Microwave chocolate in small bowl at 50 percent power, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Let chocolate cool at room temperature until it is slightly thickened and registers 80 degrees, about 10 minutes. Invert half of cookies on each sheet. Using ¼-teaspoon measure, spoon chocolate onto flat surfaces of all inverted cookies. Top with remaining cookies, pressing lightly to adhere. Let chocolate set for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
 Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk sugar, melted butter, oil, and cream cheese together in second bowl (some lumps of cream cheese will remain but will smooth out later). Add egg and yolk, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla to sugar mixture and whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and mix with rubber spatula until just combined.
 Transfer batter to prepared pan, smoothing top with spatula. Bake until light golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 33 to 38 minutes. Let bars cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 2 hours.
 Once bars are cooled, whisk lemon juice and cream cheese in bowl until combined. Add sugar and whisk until smooth. Spread glaze evenly over bars. Scatter sprinkles, if using, over top. Let glaze set fully, about 1 hour.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
Whisk flour and baking soda together in large bowl; set aside. Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling skillet and stirring constantly with silicone spatula, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Remove skillet from heat and transfer browned butter to second large bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons butter into hot butter until completely melted.
Add brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, and salt to bowl with butter and whisk until no lumps of sugar remain. Add egg and yolk and whisk until smooth. Let mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk until mixture is thick and shiny, about 1 minute. Using silicone spatula or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed and no dry flour remains.
Combine butter, chocolate, cocoa, espresso powder, and salt in now-empty large bowl. Add boiling water and whisk until butter and chocolate are completely melted, about 1 minute. Add sugar, oil, eggs and yolks, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Gently whisk in flour until just incorporated. Transfer batter to prepared pan.
Using #40 cookie scoop or heaping tablespoon measure, dollop mounds of cookie dough evenly over brownie batter (cookie dough can touch edges of pan), about 24 portions. Bake until toothpick inserted into cookie layer comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 1 hour.
Using foil overhang, lift brookies out of pan; return to wire rack and let cool completely, 1 to 1½ hours. Cut brookies into 24 pieces and sprinkle with flake sea salt, if using. Serve. (Brookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)

Whisk all-purpose flour, graham flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in bowl of stand mixer. Add melted butter, water, molasses, and vanilla. Using paddle attachment, mix until dough comes together, about 20 seconds.﻿
Transfer dough to counter and divide into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time (keep remaining piece covered with plastic wrap), roll into 12-inch circle, ⅛ inch thick, between 2 large sheets of parchment. Remove top piece of parchment. Using 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into 8 rounds; carefully transfer rounds to prepared sheets, spacing ½ inch apart. Gently reroll scraps into 8-inch circle, ⅛ inch thick, then cut into 4 rounds and transfer to sheets.
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are set, about 10 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let cookies cool completely. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 1 day.)
Whisk 3 tablespoons water and gelatin together in clean, dry bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment. Let sit until very firm, about 5 minutes.﻿
Meanwhile, combine corn syrup and remaining 3 tablespoons water in small saucepan. Pour sugar and salt into center of saucepan (do not let sugar hit saucepan sides). Bring to boil over medium-high heat and cook, gently swirling saucepan, until sugar has dissolved completely and mixture registers 240 degrees, 4 to 6 minutes.
Turn mixer speed to low and carefully pour hot syrup into gelatin mixture, avoiding whisk and sides of bowl. Gradually increase speed to high and whip until mixture is very thick and stiff and coats whisk, about 7 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add vanilla and mix until incorporated, about 15 seconds.
To assemble, place 12 cookies upside down on counter. Working with 1 cookie at a time, place 2 tablespoons marshmallow filling in center of cookie and spread evenly with back of spoon. Place second cookie on top of filling, right side up, and gently press and twist until filling is even with edges of cookies. Let sit for 15 minutes until filling is set.
Line baking sheet with clean sheet of parchment. Microwave chopped chocolate in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring often, until about two-thirds melted, 2 to 4 minutes. (Melted chocolate should not be much warmer than body temperature; check by holding bowl in palm of your hand.) Add grated chocolate and coconut oil and stir until smooth, returning to microwave for no more than 5 seconds at a time to finish melting if necessary.
Rotate filling-exposed side of 1 sandwich cookie in chocolate until filling and cookie edges are fully covered. Place sandwich cookie in chocolate and, using 2 forks, gently flip to fully coat all sides. Lift cookie out of chocolate with fork. Using offset spatula, spread chocolate on top of cookie into thin, even layer, allowing excess to run off sides. Tap fork against edge of bowl, then wipe underside of fork on edge of bowl to remove excess chocolate from bottom of cookie. Use second fork to slide sandwich cookie onto prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining sandwich cookies, returning chocolate to microwave for no more than 5 seconds at a time if it becomes too firm.

Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, stir together oats, pecans, cherries, and chocolate.
In standing mixer fitted with flat beater, beat butter and sugar at medium speed until no sugar lumps remain, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula; add egg and vanilla and beat on medium-low speed until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl; with mixer running at low speed, add flour mixture; mix until just combined, about 30 seconds. With mixer still running on low, gradually add oat/nut mixture; mix until just incorporated. Give dough final stir with rubber spatula to ensure that no flour pockets remain and ingredients are evenly distributed.
Divide dough evenly into 16 portions, each about 1/4 cup, then roll between palms into balls about 2 inches in diameter; stagger 8 balls on each baking sheet, spacing them about 2 1/2 inches apart. Using hands, gently press each dough ball to 1 inch thickness. Bake both baking sheets 12 minutes, rotate them front to back and top to bottom, then continue to bake until cookies are medium brown and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will seem underdone and will appear raw, wet, and shiny in cracks), 8 to 10 minutes longer. Do not overbake.

Macarons with Pistachio Buttercream,By_Steve Dunn_Comments,4.5,16,"1½ hours, plus 24 hours chilling",Makes 30 cookies,22,"By
Steve Dunn
Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on baking sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add sugar and salt; beat at medium-low speed until most of sugar is moistened, about 45 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds; scrape down bowl. Add heavy cream and vanilla and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice during mixing. Add pistachio paste and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip. (Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.)
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe about 2 teaspoons filling on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Melt 20 tablespoons unsalted butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, swirling skillet constantly, until milk solids in butter are color of milk chocolate and have toasty aroma, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and transfer browned butter to bowl of stand mixer. Let cool in refrigerator until opaque in color and completely cool, about 30 minutes. While butter chills, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. 
Whisk 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon table salt, ½ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon baking powder together in medium bowl. In stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat cooled butter, 1⅓ cups (9⅓ ounces) sugar, and ¼ cup nonfat dry milk powder on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons water and continue mixing until fully combined, scraping down bowl as needed with silicone spatula. With mixer running at low speed, gradually beat in flour mixture until combined. Give dough final stir with spatula to ensure no flour pockets remain.
Transfer dough to counter and divide into 2 equal pieces. Place 1 piece of dough (keep remaining piece covered with plastic wrap) in center of large sheet of parchment and press into approximate 4-inch square. Place second large sheet of parchment over dough and roll dough into 10-inch square, about ¼ inch thick. Remove top piece of parchment.
FOR DIAMONDS: Using pizza cutter or chef’s knife, trim away outer ½ inch of dough to make clean square shape with neat edges. Cut dough lengthwise into 1½-inch-wide strips, then cut diagonally into 1½-inch-wide strips to form diamonds (pieces around edges will not be whole diamonds; this is OK). Slide sheet of parchment onto rimless baking sheet (leaving cookies touching). Repeat with remaining dough.
FOR RECTANGLES: Using pizza cutter or chef's knife, trim away outer ½ inch of dough to make clean square shape with neat edges. Cut dough in 3 equal strips lengthwise (about 3 inches each), then cut into 9 equal strips crosswise (about 1 inch each). Slide sheet of parchment onto rimless baking sheet (leaving cookies touching). Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are just golden, 17 to 19 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.
Let cookies cool for 10 minutes. Cut shortbread at scored marks to separate then let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Serve. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 10 days.)

Slide sheet of parchment onto rimless baking sheet (leaving cookies touching). Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are just golden, 17 to 19 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.
Let cookies cool for 10 minutes. Cut shortbread at scored marks to separate then let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Serve.

Macarons with Semisweet Chocolate Ganache,By_Steve Dunn_Comments,4.5,40,"1½ hours, plus 27 hours chilling and cooling",Makes 30 cookies,22,"By
Steve Dunn
Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Place chocolate in heatproof bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat (do not let cream boil). Pour cream mixture over chocolate and let stand 2 minutes. Stir until smooth and glossy. Cool, stirring occasionally, until ganache has consistency of soft frosting, 3 to 4 hours. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip. (Ganache can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.)
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe about 2 teaspoons filling on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Andrew Janjigian
Whisk flour, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in bowl. Using pencil and ruler, draw 10 by 12-inch rectangle in center of each of 2 large sheets of parchment paper, crisscrossing lines at corners. (Use crisscrosses to help line up top and bottom sheets as dough is rolled.)
Process sugar in food processor for 30 seconds (some grains will be smaller than granulated sugar; others will be larger). Add butter and process until uniform mass forms and no large pieces of butter are visible, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add egg and process until smooth and paste-like, about 10 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add flour mixture and process until no dry flour remains but mixture remains crumbly, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Transfer dough to bowl and knead gently with spatula until uniform and smooth, about 10 seconds. Place 1 piece of parchment on counter with pencil side facing down (you should be able to see rectangle through paper). Place dough in center of marked rectangle and press into 6 by 9-inch rectangle. Place second sheet of parchment over dough, with pencil side facing up, so dough is in center of marked rectangle. Using pencil marks as guide, use rolling pin and bench scraper to shape dough into 10 by 12-inch rectangle of even thickness. Transfer dough with parchment to rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1½ hours (or freeze for 30 minutes). (Rolled dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower‑middle positions and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line 2 rimless baking sheets with parchment. Transfer chilled dough to counter. Gently peel off top layer of parchment from dough. Using fluted pastry wheel (or sharp knife or pizza cutter) and ruler, trim off rounded edges of dough that extend over marked edges of 10 by 12-inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into 8 equal strips about 1¼ inches wide. Cut each strip crosswise into 4 equal pieces about 3 inches long. Transfer cookies to prepared sheets, spacing them at least ½ inch apart. Bake until cookies are lightly and evenly browned, 30 to 32 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets, about 20 minutes. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 weeks.)

Macarons with Strawberry-Cardamom Buttercream,By_Steve Dunn_Comments,5,18,"1½ hours, plus 24 hours chilling",Makes 30 cookies,24,"By

Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add sugar and salt; beat at medium-low speed until most of sugar is moistened, about 45 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds; scrape down bowl. Add heavy cream and vanilla and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice during mixing.
Meanwhile, grind strawberries in spice grinder until reduced to fine powder. Sift powder through fine-mesh strainer set over small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons powder and cardamom to buttercream and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add more strawberry powder to taste, as desired. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip. (Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.)
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe about 2 teaspoons filling on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

 Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Using ruler and pencil, draw two 8 by 3-inch rectangles, spaced 4 inches apart, on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, marked side down.
 Pulse 1 cup hazelnuts in food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl and set aside. Process remaining ¼ cup hazelnuts in now-empty processor until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour, cocoa, baking powder, espresso powder, and salt and process until combined, about 15 seconds. Transfer flour mixture to second bowl.
 Process 2 eggs in again-empty processor until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter and vanilla and process until combined, about 10 seconds. Transfer egg mixture to bowl. Sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg mixture and, using spatula, gently fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and chopped hazelnuts and gently fold until just combined.
 Divide dough in half. Using your floured hands, form each half into 8 by 3-inch rectangle, using lines on parchment as guide. Spray each loaf lightly with oil spray. Using rubber spatula lightly coated with oil spray, smooth tops and sides of rectangles. Gently brush tops of rectangles with egg white wash. Bake until loaves are set and beginning to crack on top, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.
 Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes. Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into ½-inch-thick slices. Lay slices cut side down, about ¼ inch apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp on both sides, about 35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking. Let biscotti cool completely on wire rack, about 1 hour, before serving. (Biscotti can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.)

For the cookies: In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In small bowl, whisk together egg and vanilla.
Add sugar to food processor and lock lid into place. Turn on processor and process until sugar is finely ground, about 30 seconds.
Stop processor and remove lid. Add chilled butter to processor and lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Stop processor and remove lid. Add egg mixture and flour mixture and lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process until no dry flour is visible and mixture forms crumbly dough, about 30 seconds.
Stop processor, remove lid, and carefully remove processor blade (ask an adult for help). Use rubber spatula to transfer dough to center of large sheet of parchment paper on counter.
Use your hands to pat dough into 7-by-9-inch oval. Place second large sheet of parchment on top of dough. Use rolling pin to roll dough into 10-by-14-inch oval (⅛ to ¼ inch thick), rolling dough between parchment.
Slide dough (still between parchment) onto 1 baking sheet. Place baking sheet in refrigerator and refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1½ hours.
While dough is chilling, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line second baking sheet with parchment.
When dough is ready, remove dough from refrigerator. Gently peel off top sheet of parchment. Use cookie cutters to cut dough into shapes. (After cutting out your cookie shapes, put all the leftover dough scraps together, reroll the dough between sheets of parchment paper to ⅛- to ¼-inch thickness, and cut out more shapes. It’s best to do this only one time—if you reroll this dough more than once, the cookies will turn out tough.)
Use spatula to transfer shapes to parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced about ½ inch apart. (If dough becomes too warm and sticky to transfer shapes easily, return it to refrigerator to firm up again, about 10 minutes.)
Place baking sheet in oven. Bake cookies until beginning to brown around edges, 18 to 22 minutes.
Use oven mitts to remove baking sheet from oven and place on cooling rack (ask an adult for help). Let cookies cool completely on baking sheet, about 30 minutes.
For the glaze and decorations: While cookies are cooling, in second medium bowl, combine confectioners’ sugar, milk, softened cream cheese, and food coloring (if using). Use clean rubber spatula to stir until very smooth.
Glaze and decorate cookies following photos, “Step-by-Step: How to Glaze and Decorate Cookies,” below. Let glaze dry completely, about 30 minutes, before serving.

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Process almonds in food processor until they resemble coarse sand, about 30 seconds.
Bring cream, butter, and sugar to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken, 5 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to brown at edges and is thick enough to leave trail that doesn’t immediately fill in when spatula is scraped along pan bottom, 1 to 2 minutes longer (it’s OK if some darker speckles appear in mixture). Remove pan from heat and stir in almonds, marmalade, flour, vanilla, orange zest, and salt until combined.
Drop 6 level tablespoons dough at least 3½ inches apart on each prepared sheet. When cool enough to handle, use damp fingers to press each portion into 2 1/2-inch circle.
Bake until deep brown from edge to edge, 15 to 17 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer cookies, still on parchment, to wire racks and let cool. Let baking sheets cool for 10 minutes, line with fresh parchment, and repeat portioning and baking remaining dough.
Microwave 3 ounces (85 grams) chocolate in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring frequently, until about two-thirds melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from microwave, add remaining 1 ounce (28 grams) chocolate, and stir until melted, returning to microwave for no more than 5 seconds at a time to complete melting if necessary. Transfer chocolate to small zipper-lock bag and snip off corner, making hole no larger than 1/16 inch.
Transfer cooled cookies directly to wire racks. Pipe zigzag of chocolate over each cookie, distributing chocolate evenly among all cookies. Refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes, before serving. (Cookies can be stored at cool room temperature for up to 4 days.)

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimless baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stop mixer. Add flour and mix on low speed until mixture comes together in crumbly dough, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer to work surface and knead gently until dough forms smooth ball.
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Gently roll and pinch each piece into 14-inch log (if dough cracks, pinch it back together). Arrange logs lengthwise on prepared sheet. Press your index finger along length of 1 log to create trough that is ¾ inch wide and ¼ inch to ⅓ inch deep, using fingers of your other hand to mold sides. Repeat with remaining logs.
Whisk jam and lemon juice in bowl until smooth. Transfer mixture to piping bag fitted with ¼-inch round tip and pipe evenly among troughs. Bake until logs are lightly browned and firm to touch, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Cool on sheet until just warm to touch.
Gently slide logs into center of sheet until touching. Whisk confectioners' sugar and water in small bowl until smooth. (If mixture is too thick to drizzle, whisk in more water, ½ teaspoon at a time.) Using spoon, drizzle icing over cookies. Let sit until icing is set, 25 to 30 minutes.
Run thin spatula under 1 log to release from parchment. Carefully transfer log to cutting board. Using sharp chef's knife at 45-degree angle, trim ½ inch from each end of log and discard trim. Slice remaining length on diagonal into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining logs. Serve. (Store cookies at room temperature for up to 6 days.)

 Combine peanut butter, sugar, and salt in bowl. Using fork or your hands, stir and mash mixture until thoroughly combined and no dry pockets of sugar remain. Divide filling into 16 equal portions (about 2 teaspoons each). Roll each portion into ball and place on large plate. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
 Meanwhile, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Microwave 6 ounces (170 grams) chocolate, oil, and butter in second medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 3 minutes. Whisk vanilla into melted chocolate mixture until combined.
Whisk 1 cup granulated sugar and eggs in large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add melted chocolate mixture and whisk until uniform. Using rubber spatula, fold in flour mixture until combined. Fold in remaining 4 ounces (113 grams) chocolate.
Divide dough into 16 equal portions, about scant 3 tablespoons (1⅞ ounces or 53 grams) each; divide any remaining dough evenly among portions. Use your fingers to flatten 1 dough portion into disk with roughly 3-inch diameter. Place 1 ball of filling in center of disk. Wrap edges of dough up and around filling, seal dough, and shape into smooth ball. Repeat with remaining dough portions and filling.
 Place confectioners' sugar and remaining ⅓ cup granulated sugar in 2 separate shallow dishes. Working in batches, roll dough balls first in granulated sugar, then in confectioners' sugar, to coat. Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 8 dough balls per sheet.
 Using bottom of drinking glass, flatten dough balls into 2-inch-wide disks. (Dough balls will crack at edges; this is OK. If filling shows through any large cracks, pinch dough together to seal cracks.) Bake until cookies are puffed, edges are just set, and cookies no longer look raw between cracks, about 22 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking.

Whisk semolina, all-purpose flour, and mahlab together in large bowl. Add butter, honey, orange blossom water, and rose water. Using your hands, gently fold semolina mixture over wet ingredients until rough dough forms. Continue folding dough over itself into center while turning bowl, rubbing butter into semolina mixture until cohesive dough forms. (Do not knead dough; it should feel like wet sand.) Cover bowl tightly and let dough stand at room temperature for 4 hours.
Pulse pistachios, anise, cinnamon, mahlab, and salt in food processor until pistachios are chopped into rough ¼-inch pieces, 5 to 7 pulses. Add dates, butter, and honey and process until mixture is smooth paste and pistachio pieces are ⅛ to 1/16 inch, about 20 seconds. Transfer to bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
Microwave milk and salt for dough in bowl until just warm (about 110 degrees), 30 to 45 seconds. Sprinkle yeast over warm milk and stir to combine. Add milk mixture to dough and mix with hands until combined, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to counter (don't wash bowl) and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Return dough to bowl, cover tightly, and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
While dough rests, line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide filling into 30 equal portions, weighing about ½ ounce each, and roll into balls. Place balls on 1 half of 1 prepared sheet. Cover with damp dish towel.
Divide dough into 2 equal portions (dough will be slightly tacky, soft, and somewhat elastic). Roll each piece into 15-inch log and cut into 15 equal pieces. Roll each portion into ball and place on sheet with filling. Cover with damp dish towel.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place 1 dough ball in palm of your hand and gently press into 3-inch round of even thickness. Place 1 filling ball in center of dough. Bring sides of dough up around filling and pinch top to seal. Roll ball until smooth, place on second prepared baking sheet, and cover with damp dish towel. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Place 1 filled ball in ma’amoul mold and gently press until cookie fills crevices and top is flat. Turn mold over and tap edge on edge of counter so cookie releases onto palm of hand. (If cookie sticks, line mold with plastic wrap.) Return cookie, pattern side up, to baking sheet. Repeat, placing 15 cookies, evenly spaced, on each sheet.

 Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Whisk flour and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.
 Melt 5 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Continue to cook, swirling skillet constantly, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir until completely melted.
 Add brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, water, and salt to butter; whisk until fully incorporated. Add egg yolk; whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times (mixture should be thick, smooth, and shiny). Using rubber spatula, stir in flour mixture until just combined (dough will be stiff), about 1 minute. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts, if using. Give dough final stir by hand to ensure no flour pockets remain and ingredients are evenly distributed.
 Working with 3 tablespoons dough at a time, roll into balls and space them 2 inches apart on prepared sheet. Bake until cookies are golden brown and still puffy and edges have begun to set but centers are soft, 10 to 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cookies cool completely before serving. (Cookies can be stored in zipper-lock bag for up to 3 days.)

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heatoven to 350 degrees. Spray 9-inch springform pan and ovensafe 2-inch round cutter with vegetable oil spray.
Combine flour, sugar, and salt in bowl. Add melted butter and vanilla; stir with silicone spatula until evenly moistened. Crumble dough over bottom of prepared pan. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press dough into even layer. Using fork, poke dough all over.
Press 2-inch round cutter into center of dough. Keeping cutter in place and using small spoon or offset spatula, gently remove center round of dough; discard or bake separately. Bake crust until edges are light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, gently press on entire surface of warm crust to compress. Let crust cool for at least 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine sugar, condensed milk, cream, corn syrup, butter, and salt in small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently with silicone spatula, until mixture registers between 236 and 239 degrees (temperature will fluctuate), 16 to 20 minutes. Off heat, stir in vanilla and 1 cup coconut. Pour caramel mixture over crust and, using silicone spatula, spread to even thickness (mixture will be very hot). Sprinkle evenly with remaining ½ cup coconut. Let cool completely, at least 1½ hours. (Cookie can be loosely wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours.)
Microwave chopped chocolate in liquid measuring cup at 50 percent power, stirring every 15 seconds, until melted but not much warmer than body temperature (check by holding in palm of your hand), 1 to 2 minutes. Add grated chocolate and stir until smooth, returning to microwave for no more than 5 seconds at a time to finish melting if necessary.
Remove side of pan and cutter in center of dough; invert cookie onto inverted rimmed baking sheet. Pour ¼ cup melted chocolate onto cookie in even band around hole in center, about ½ inch from hole. Using small offset spatula, gently spread chocolate to completely cover cookie. Repeat with additional ¼ cup chocolate. Refrigerate until chocolate is set, 20 to 25 minutes.
If remaining ½ cup chocolate has hardened, microwave until just remelted, stirring every 10 seconds. Transfer chocolate to pastry bag or small zipper-lock bag and snip off corner, making about ⅛-inch hole. Invert cookie, chocolate side down, onto wire rack. Carefully place rack in now-empty rimmed baking sheet. Pipe remaining chocolate in zigzags across caramel layer. Refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes. Using large offset spatula, transfer cookie to cutting board. Using chef's knife, cut cookie into 2-inch wedges. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 4 days.)

Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Whisk passion fruit puree, sugar, and cornstarch together in medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick paste forms, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate until melted, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly, then whisk in butter in 3 additions, until smooth and glossy. Press lightly greased parchment against surface of curd, and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip.
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe about 2 teaspoons filling on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Place 1 cup (8 ounces) turbinado sugar in medium saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar liquifies completely and turns a dark caramel brown but doesn’t bubble, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and carefully pour in ½ cup water (mixture will bubble). Return pan to medium heat and continue to cook until mixture is fully incorporated and syrup is reduced to about ¾ cup, 2 to 5 minutes.
Transfer syrup to heatproof container and let cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Reserve ¼ cup caramelized sugar syrup for this recipe; reserve remaining for another use. (Store syrup in airtight container or bottle at room temperature.)
Whisk 1½ cups (7½ ounces) all-purpose flour, ⅓ cup finely chopped candied ginger, 1 tablespoon ground ginger, 1½ teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon ground allspice, and ½ teaspoon table salt together in medium bowl.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat 8 tablespoons softened unsalted butter, ½ cup (3½ ounces) packed light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger, and ¼ cup reserved caramelized sugar syrup on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add 1 large egg and continue to mix until fully incorporated. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture; mix until dough just comes together and no dry patches of flour remain. Refrigerate dough until chilled, at least 2 hours (dough can be refrigerated for up to 2 days).
About 15 minutes before dough is done chilling, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 cup (8 ounces) turbinado sugar in shallow dish.
Divide dough into 18 equal portions, a scant 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) each. Roll into balls then add to dish with turbinado sugar and turn to fully coat. Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 9 per sheet.
Bake cookies until slightly darker at edges and puffed on top (cookies may seem underdone between cracks), about 8 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Remove sheet from oven and transfer to wire rack; immediately bang sheet on rack to collapse cookies.

Place egg in small saucepan, cover with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill small bowl with ice water. Using slotted spoon, transfer egg to ice water and let stand 5 minutes. Crack egg and peel shell. Separate yolk from white; discard white. Press yolk through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl.
In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter, granulated sugar, salt, and cooked egg yolk on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl and beater with rubber spatula as needed. Turn mixer to low, add vanilla, and mix until incorporated. Stop mixer; add flour and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using rubber spatula, press dough into cohesive mass.
Divide dough in half; roll each piece into log about 6 inches long and 1 3/4 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in 12-inch square of parchment paper and twist ends to seal and firmly compact dough into tight cylinder (see illustrations below). Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using chef’s knife, slice dough into ¼-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place cookies 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Using pastry brush, gently brush cookies with egg white mixture and sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar.
Bake until centers of cookies are pale golden brown with edges slightly darker than centers, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes; using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and cool to room temperature. Store cooled cookies between sheets of parchment paper in airtight container for up to 1 week.

Place each disk between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and roll into 9-inch circle. Stack dough circles, between parchment, on plate; freeze for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, process apricot preserves in food processor until smooth, about 10 seconds. Combine sugar and cinnamon in small bowl; set aside. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 dough circle at a time, remove dough from freezer, gently peel parchment from dough to loosen, but leave in place. Spread dough with 2½ tablespoons preserves. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, ¼ cup raisins, and ½ cup walnuts over preserves and pat down gently with your fingers. Cut circle into 8 wedges. Roll each wedge into crescent shape; space crescents 2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Freeze crescents on sheets for 15 minutes.
FOR THE GLAZE: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower- middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Whisk egg yolks and milk in bowl. Brush crescents with glaze. Bake until rugelach are pale golden and slightly puffy, 21 to 23 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Sprinkle each cookie with scant teaspoon cinnamon sugar. Transfer rugelach to wire rack with metal spatula. Let rugelach cool completely before serving. (Rugelach can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 days.)
TO MAKE AHEAD: In step 2, space formed crescents ½ inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover baking sheet loosely with plastic wrap and freeze cookies until firm, about 1¼ hours. Once frozen, transfer cookies to airtight container and freeze for up to 6 weeks. To bake frozen rugelach, place on parchment-lined baking sheets and glaze and bake immediately, increasing baking tie by 6 to 7 minutes.

In workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process remaining chopped nuts until the texture of coarse cornmeal, 10 to 15 seconds (do not overprocess); stir into flour mixture and set aside. (To finely grind chopped nuts by hand, roll them between two large sheets plastic wrap with rolling pin, applying moderate pressure, until broken down to coarse cornmeal-like texture).
In bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed or by hand, beat butter and sugar until light and creamy, about 1 1/2 minutes with an electric mixer or 4 minutes by hand; beat in vanilla. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula; add flour mixture and beat at low speed until dough just begins to come together but still looks scrappy, about 15 seconds. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl again with rubber spatula; continue beating at low speed until dough is cohesive, 6 to 9 seconds longer. Do not overbeat.
Working with about one tablespoon dough at a time, roll and shape cookies into balls, crescents, rings, or cigar shapes as desired, (see illustrations below). Bake until tops are pale golden and bottoms are just beginning to brown, turning cookie sheets from front to back and switching from top to bottom racks halfway through baking, 17 to 19 minutes.

Whisk 1¼ cups (6¼ ounces) all-purpose flour and ½ teaspoon table salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Fit mixer with dough hook; add ½ cup water; and mix on low speed until cohesive dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Transfer dough to liberally floured counter. Pat dough into 4-inch square. Lightly flour top of dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Roll dough into 15 by 13-inch rectangle with short side parallel to counter’s edge, using bench scraper to release dough and re-flouring counter as needed. Brush excess flour from top of dough. Scatter 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces and softened, crosswise over center third of dough. Using small offset spatula, spread butter evenly into 5 by 12-inch rectangle, leaving ½-inch border on each side.
Fold top third of dough over butter layer, then brush away excess flour from folded portion. Fold bottom third of dough over top third to create 5 by 13-inch rectangle, and brush away excess flour.
Rotate dough 90 degrees. Re-flour counter, and repeat rolling dough into 15 by 13-inch rectangle, spreading butter, folding, and rotating dough twice more using remaining 10 tablespoons butter.
Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll dough into 15 by 13-inch rectangle with short side parallel to counter edge and brush excess flour from dough. Using your moistened finger or pastry brush, brush top edge of dough lightly with water. Starting at short side, roll dough away from you into tight log and pinch seam to seal. Transfer log to prepared sheet, seam side down; cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours.
Spray 12-cup muffin tin with vegetable oil spray. Using sharp knife, trim ends of dough log to create 12-inch log. Cut log into 12 equal pieces, and place 1 piece into each muffin cup, cut side up.
Using your moistened fingers, press dough pieces evenly into bottoms and up sides of muffin cups until dough just reaches tops of cups, taking care to press dough evenly into corners and avoid tearing. (If dough is very cold, allow pieces to sit in cups at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes until dough can be pressed without cracking around edges.) Cover tin with plastic and refrigerate until dough is well chilled, at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours.
Whisk ¼ cup whole milk, 3 tablespoons flour, and ¾ teaspoon salt in large bowl until smooth. Whisk 6 lightly beaten large egg yolks in second large bowl until smooth. Set fine-mesh strainer over 4-cup liquid measuring cup.
Combine 1¼ cup (8¾ ounces) granulated sugar, ½ cup water, and remaining 1 cup milk in medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk hot milk mixture into flour mixture until smooth. Gently whisk warm flour mixture into egg yolks until evenly combined. Strain mixture through prepared strainer into measuring cup; discard solids. (Custard will be thin.) Add 2 (3-inch) strips lemon zest and 1 cinnamon stick to custard, then let custard sit at room temperature for 1 hour, or refrigerate for up to 12 hours; discard zest and cinnamon.
One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, place baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. (If custard was refrigerated, let it sit at room temp while oven is preheating.) Just before baking, whisk custard to recombine. Divide custard evenly among dough cups in muffin tin, filling to just below rim and being careful not to overfill. (You may have extra custard; this is OK.) Bake until custard is puffed and spotty brown on most tarts and dough is deep golden brown and crisp around edges, 27 to 30 minutes.
Let tarts cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 5 minutes. Using small spatula, transfer tarts to wire rack and let cool for at least 30 minutes. Dust tops of tarts lightly with confectioners’ sugar and ground cinnamon, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature. (To rewarm tarts, bake on rimmed baking sheet on middle rack of 350-degree oven for 5 to 7 minutes.)

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1/2 cup sugar for dipping in 8- or 9-inch cake pan.
Whisk flour, baking soda, spices, and salt in medium bowl until thoroughly combined; set aside.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter with brown and granulated sugars at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low and add yolk and vanilla; increase speed to medium and beat until incorporated, about 20 seconds. Reduce speed to medium-low and add molasses; beat until fully incorporated, about 20 seconds, scraping bottom and sides of bowl once with rubber spatula. Reduce speed to lowest setting; add flour mixture and beat until just incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping bowl down once. Give dough final stir with rubber spatula to ensure that no pockets of flour remain at bottom. Dough will be soft.
Using tablespoon measure, scoop heaping tablespoon of dough and roll between palms into 11/2-inch ball; drop ball into cake pan with sugar and repeat to form about 4 balls. Toss balls in sugar to coat and set on prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are browned, still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), about 11 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Do not overbake.
Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes, then use wide metal spatula to transfer cookies to wire rack; cool cookies to room temperature. When completely cool, return cookies to cooled parchment-lined baking sheets. Whisk confectioners' sugar and 2 1/2 tablespoons dark rum in medium bowl until smooth. If the glaze is too thick to drizzle, whisk in additional tablespoon rum. Dip spoon into glaze and then move spoon over cookies so that glaze drizzles down onto them; repeat as necessary. Transfer cookies to wire rack and allow glaze to dry, 10 to 15 minutes.

Stir melted butter, black cocoa, Dutch-processed cocoa, and espresso powder in bowl until combined and smooth.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat remaining 5 tablespoons butter, sugar, salt, and cocoa mixture on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add egg yolk and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low and slowly add flour in 3 additions, mixing well after each addition and scraping down bowl as needed. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 30 seconds.
Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 6-inch log. Wrap logs tightly in plastic wrap, twisting ends to firmly compact dough into tight cylinder, and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Trim ends of dough logs, then slice into ⅛-inch-thick rounds and space them ½ inch apart on prepared sheets.
Bake until cookies are firm and reveal slight indentation when pressed with your finger, 14 to 16 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cookies cool completely.
Using clean, dry mixer bowl and paddle, mix butter, shortening, sugar, vanilla, and salt on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Place rounded ½ teaspoon filling in center of bottom of half of cookies, then top with remaining cookies, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Serve. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 week.)

Macarons with Peanut Butter Cream and Jam,By_Steve Dunn_Comments,4.5,5,"1½ hours, plus 24 hours chilling",Makes 30 cookies,22,"By
Steve Dunn
Using pencil and 1½-inch round biscuit cutter as guide, trace thirty 1½-inch circles on each of 2 pieces of parchment (5 evenly spaced rows of 6 circles on each piece of parchment). Spray 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Place templates pencil side down on baking sheets and smooth to adhere. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl and set aside.
Measure 75 grams of egg whites into bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment (reserve remaining whites). Add cream of tartar. Start mixer on medium-high speed and whip until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes (see ""A"" in ""Making the Shells""). Turn mixer to lowest speed and let run while you make sugar syrup.
Using heatproof spatula, gently stir sugar and water together in small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, checking temperature frequently, until sugar syrup reaches 245 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes.
When syrup reaches 245 degrees, quickly remove pan from heat; adjust mixer speed to medium; and carefully pour syrup into whites in thin, steady stream (avoid hitting whisk; aim for side of bowl just above whites; see ""B"" in ""Making the Shells""). Add food coloring; increase speed to medium-high; and continue to whip until meringue is just shy of stiff peaks (very tip of peak should bend to 2 or 3 o'clock), 3 to 5 minutes (see ""C"" in ""Making the Shells"").
Transfer meringue and reserved 38 grams egg whites to almond flour mixture. Using large rubber spatula, stir to incorporate. Turning bowl, stir and smear batter against sides of bowl, scraping sides and bottom frequently until batter loosens and flows from spatula in slow, wide stream for 8 to 10 seconds and reincorporates into batter within about 30 seconds (see ""D"" in ""Making the Shells""). (To test consistency, place spoonful of batter on prepared sheet and let sit for 1 minute. If batter spreads into flat, smooth-topped disk, continue with recipe; if it remains domed, continue stirring, taking care not to overmix, and retest.)
Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round tip. Hold bag perpendicular to sheet and about ½ inch above sheet. Using template as guide, pipe batter into 1½-inch-wide disks, keeping bag still as batter flows from tip. To finish each disk, use quick flick of your wrist to cut off batter stream (see ""E"" in ""Making the Shells""). Rap sheets firmly on counter 6 times to release air bubbles. Let rest until shells form skin that can be touched gently with your finger without marring surface, about 20 minutes (""F"" in ""Making the Shells""). While shells dry, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Bake 1 sheet of shells for 13 minutes. To test for doneness, place your finger gently on top of 1 shell and move it side to side; if center feels loose and jiggly, continue to bake, checking every minute, until firm. Transfer sheet to wire rack and bake remaining shells. Let shells cool completely on sheets. While shells cool, make filling.
Microwave peanut butter and butter in medium bowl until butter is melted, about 40 seconds. Using rubber spatula, stir in sugar until combined. Cool to room temperature. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with ½-inch round or star tip.
Gently peel shells from parchment (see ""G"" in ""Making the Shells""). (If shells don't release cleanly, place sheets in freezer for 10 minutes.) Holding 1 upturned shell in your hand, pipe ring of peanut butter cream on top, leaving ⅛-inch border. Spoon ½ teaspoon jam inside peanut butter ring. Place second shell on top of filling, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Repeat with remaining shells, filling, and jam. Arrange cookies on clean parchment-lined sheet and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Place egg in small saucepan, cover with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill small bowl with ice water. Using slotted spoon, transfer egg to ice water and let stand 5 minutes. Crack egg and peel shell. Separate yolk from white; discard white. Press yolk through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl.
In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter, granulated sugar, salt, and cooked egg yolk on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl and beater with rubber spatula as needed. Turn mixer to low, add vanilla and lemon zest, and mix until incorporated. Stop mixer; add flour and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using rubber spatula, press dough into cohesive mass.
Divide dough in half; roll each piece into log about 6 inches long and 1 3/4 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in 12-inch square of parchment paper and twist ends to seal and firmly compact dough into tight cylinder (see illustrations below). Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using chef’s knife, slice dough into ¼-inch-thick rounds, rotating dough so that it won’t become misshapen from weight of knife. Place cookies 1 inch apart on baking sheets.
Bake until centers of cookies are pale golden brown with edges slightly darker than centers, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes; using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and cool to room temperature. Once cookies have cooled, dust with confectioners' sugar. Store cooled cookies between sheets of parchment paper in airtight container for up to 1 week.

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Process almonds in food processor until they resemble coarse sand, about 30 seconds.
Bring cream, butter, and sugar to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken, 5 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to brown at edges and is thick enough to leave trail that doesn’t immediately fill in when spatula is scraped along pan bottom, 1 to 2 minutes longer (some darker speckles may appear in mixture). Remove pan from heat and stir in ground almonds, marmalade, flour blend, vanilla, zest, and salt until combined.
Drop 6 level tablespoons of dough onto each prepared sheet spaced at least 3½ inches apart. When dough is cool enough to handle, use damp fingers to press each portion into 2½-inch circle.
Bake until deep brown from edge to edge, 15 to 17 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer baked cookies, still on parchment, to wire rack to cool. Let sheets cool for 10 minutes, line with fresh parchment, then repeat portioning and baking remaining dough.
Microwave 3 ounces (85 grams) chocolate in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring frequently, until about two-thirds of chocolate has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from microwave and add remaining 1 ounce (28 grams) chocolate and stir until melted, returning to microwave for no more than 5 seconds at a time to complete melting if necessary. Transfer chocolate to small zipper-lock bag and snip off corner to make hole no larger than 1/16 inch.
Transfer cooled cookies from parchment directly to wire racks. Pipe zigzag of chocolate over surface of each cookie, distributing chocolate evenly among all cookies. Refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at cool room temperature for up to 4 days.)

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Using ruler and permanent marker, draw two 8 by 3-inch rectangles, spaced 4 inches apart, on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, ink side down.
Pulse 1 cup hazelnuts in food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl and set aside. Process remaining 1/4 cup hazelnuts in food processor until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour, rosemary, baking powder, and salt; process to combine, about 15 seconds. Transfer flour mixture to bowl. Process 2 eggs in now-empty food processor until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter, orange zest, orange liqueur, and vanilla; process until combined, about 10 seconds. Transfer egg mixture to medium bowl. Sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg mixture and, using spatula, gently fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and chopped hazelnuts and gently fold until just combined.
Divide batter in half. Using floured hands, form each half into 8 by 3-inch rectangle, using lines on parchment as guide. Spray each loaf lightly with oil spray. Using rubber spatula lightly coated with oil spray, smooth tops and sides of rectangles. Gently brush tops of loaves with egg white wash. Bake until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.
Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes. Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Lay slices, cut side down, about 1/4 inch apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking. Let cool completely before serving. Biscotti can be stored in airtight container for up to 1 month.

America's Test Kitchen
Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions; heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl; set aside.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment or with hand mixer, beat butter, 1 cup granulated sugar, and brown sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add egg and vanilla; beat at medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add dry ingredients and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed.
Place sugar for rolling in shallow bowl. Fill medium bowl halfway with cold tap water. Dip hands in water and shake off excess (this will prevent dough from sticking to your hands and ensure that sugar sticks to dough). Roll heaping tablespoon dough into 1 1/2-inch ball between moistened palms; roll ball in sugar, then place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, moistening hands after forming each ball and spacing balls about 2 inches apart on baking sheet (you should be able to fit 12 cookies on each sheet).

Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions; heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl; set aside.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment or with hand mixer, beat butter, 1 cup granulated sugar, and brown sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add egg and vanilla; beat at medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add dry ingredients and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed.
Place sugar for rolling in shallow bowl. Fill medium bowl halfway with cold tap water. Dip hands in water and shake off excess (this will prevent dough from sticking to your hands and ensure that sugar sticks to dough). Roll heaping tablespoon dough into 1 1/2-inch ball between moistened palms; roll ball in sugar, then place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, moistening hands after forming each ball and spacing balls about 2 inches apart on baking sheet (you should be able to fit 12 cookies on each sheet). Using butter wrapper, butter bottom of drinking glass; dip bottom of glass in remaining sugar and flatten dough balls with bottom of glass until dough is about 3/4 inch thick.

In bowl of standing mixer fitted with flat beater, mix flour, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. With mixer running on low, add butter 1 piece at a time; continue to mix until mixture looks crumbly and slightly wet, about 1 minute longer. Add vanilla and cream cheese and mix on low until dough just begins to form large clumps, about 30 seconds.
Remove bowl from mixer; knead dough by hand in bowl for 2 to 3 turns to form large cohesive mass. Turn out dough onto countertop; divide in half, pat into two 4-inch disks, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate until they begin to firm up, 20 to 30 minutes. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen up to 2 weeks; defrost in refrigerator before using.)
Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll out 1 dough disk to even 1/8-inch thickness between 2 large sheets parchment paper; slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and chill until firm, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with second disk.
Working with first portion of rolled dough, cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s) and place shapes on parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake until light golden brown, about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time. Repeat with second portion of rolled dough. (Dough scraps can be patted together, chilled, and re-rolled once.) Cool cookies on wire rack to room temperature.
Whisk cream cheese and 2 tablespoons milk in medium bowl until combined and no lumps remain. Whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth, adding remaining milk as needed until glaze is thin enough to spread easily.

Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat all ingredients on low speed until sugar is mostly moistened, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.
Line rimmed baking sheet or large, flat plate with parchment paper. Using tablespoon measure and small spoon (or #60 scoop), divide filling into 12 equal portions on prepared plate. Use back of spoon to lightly flatten each portion into rough disk shape (no greater than 1½ inches in diameter). Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. (Filling can be frozen for up to 1 week.)
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, cocoa, salt, and baking soda together in large bowl.
Whisk melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in second large bowl until smooth. Whisk in eggs, lemon zest, vanilla, and food coloring until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. Stir in half of flour mixture with rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir in chocolate chips, pecans, and remaining flour mixture. (Mixture will be stiff; once dough begins to stiffen, you can mix with your hands until dough is evenly combined.)
Divide dough into 12 equal portions (about 3½ ounces; 99 grams; or ⅓ cup each). Flatten each dough portion into disk shape, about 3 inches in diameter. Working quickly, place 1 disk of frozen filling in center of each dough disk. Wrap edges of dough up and around filling, seal dough, and shape into smooth disk shape (about 3½ inches in diameter and ½ inch thick), taking care to ensure filling remains in center of each cookie. Space cookies evenly on prepared sheets, 6 cookies per sheet.
Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges of cookies are beginning to puff and crack, 7 to 8 minutes. Let cookies cool completely on sheets, about 2 hours. Serve.

Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press firmly into even layer using bottom of dry measuring cup. Bake until crust is fragrant and beginning to brown, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 30 minutes.
For the filling Whisk eggs and yolks together in medium saucepan. Whisk in granulated sugar until combined, then whisk in lemon zest and juice and salt. Add butter and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly and registers 170 degrees, about 5 minutes. Immediately strain mixture in fine-mesh strainer into bowl and stir in cream. Pour filling over cooled crust. Bake until filling is shiny and opaque and center jiggles slightly when shaken, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let bars cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 2 hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. Cut into 16 pieces and dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk 1⅔ cups (8⅓ ounces) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon table salt, and ¾ teaspoon baking soda together in bowl.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat 12 tablespoons softened unsalted butter and 1 cup packed (7 ounces) dark brown sugar on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add 1 large egg and 1 large yolk, 2 tablespoons vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons molasses and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 2 additions until just combined and no dry flour remains. Add 2 cups (12 ounces) pitted dates, chopped, and beat until evenly incorporated, about 15 seconds.
Using #20 portion scoop, scoop dough into 16 portions, about 3 tablespoons each, and evenly space on prepared sheets (8 per sheet); divide any remaining dough among portions. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are browned and centers are puffed and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely.
While cookies are cooling, melt 4 tablespoons butter with 5 teaspoons water in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in ¼ cup packed (1¾ ounces) dark brown sugar and ⅛ teaspoon salt and continue to cook, whisking often, until mixture is gently bubbling all over and lightened in color, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer butter mixture to bowl and whisk in ½ cup (2 ounces) confectioners’ sugar until smooth.
Using small spoon, top each cookie with about 1 teaspoon glaze; use back of spoon to spread glaze evenly over cookie. Let glaze set for at least 15 minutes. Serve.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with vegetable oil spray. Pulse 1 cup almonds in food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl.
Process remaining ¼ cup almonds in now-empty food processor until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and process to combine, about 15 seconds; transfer to separate bowl.
Process 2 eggs in now-empty food processor until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add Sucanat until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter, almond extract, and vanilla and process until combined, about 10 seconds; transfer to large bowl.
Sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg mixture and, using rubber spatula, fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and chopped almonds and fold until just combined.
Divide batter in half. Using your floured hands, press dough into two 8 by 3-inch loaves on prepared baking sheet, spaced about 4 inches apart. Brush loaves with beaten egg white. Bake loaves until golden and just beginning to crack on top, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.
Let loaves cool on sheet for 30 minutes, then transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into ½-inch-thick slices. Lay slices, cut side down, about ¼ inch apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake cookies until crisp and light golden brown on both sides, 25 to 30 minutes, flipping slices and rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let biscotti cool completely on rack before serving.

America's Test Kitchen
Set racks in upper-middle and lower-middle levels of oven and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Place 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon egg whites in a small bowl. Place remaining in second bowl and beat lightly, set aside for dipping. Turn almonds into food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade; process 1 minute. Add sugar; process 15 seconds longer. Add first bowl of egg whites and extract; process until the paste wads around blade. Scrape sides and corners of workbowl with spatula; process until stiff but cohesive, malleable paste (similar in consistency to marzipan or pasta dough) forms, about 5 seconds longer. If mixture is crumbly or dry, turn machine back on and add water by drops through feeder tube until proper consistency is reached.
Allowing scant 2 tablespoons of paste for each macaroon, form a dozen cookies upon each paper-lined sheet. Roll into 1-inch balls between your palms . (Rinse and dry your hands if they become too sticky.) Dip each ball into beaten egg white, then roll in pine nuts, lightly pressing with fingertips, (see illustration 5 below). Transfer cookies to parchment-lined baking sheet and flatten slightly with fingers, making inch-wide buttons, (illustration 6).
Bake macaroons, switching cookie sheet positions midway through baking, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If overbaked, macaroons will dry out rather quickly when stored. Leave macaroons on papers until completely cooled or else they may tear. (Can be stored in an airtight container for at least 4 days or frozen up to 1 month.)

Hamantaschen with Poppy Seed Filling,By_Jessica Rudolph_Comments,5,3,"2 hours, plus 2 hours chilling",Makes about 30 cookies,16,"By
Jessica Rudolph
Working in 3 batches, grind poppy seeds in spice grinder until fine and powdery (but stop before paste forms), 15 to 30 seconds per batch (scrape bottom of spice grinder clean between batches). Bring cream, honey, and salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in ground poppy seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened, liquid is absorbed, and seeds begin to clump together, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in butter, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla. Transfer filling to bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (Cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, cream cheese, and salt on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add egg and vanilla and continue to beat until well incorporated, about 1 minute longer. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until dough is uniform, about 1 minute. Divide dough in half. Transfer each half to sheet of plastic wrap, form into 6-inch disk, wrap tightly, and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Unwrap 1 dough disk, place in center of large piece of parchment, and cover with second large piece of parchment. Roll dough into 12-inch round of uniform ⅛-inch thickness, occasionally flipping dough and gently peeling off and replacing parchment to avoid creases. Refrigerate rolled dough sheet between parchment while repeating rolling (between parchment) with remaining dough disk.
Peel off top piece of parchment from 1 rolled dough sheet. Using 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into 11 or 12 rounds and space evenly on prepared sheet. Dollop 1 heaping teaspoon filling in center of each round. Working with 1 round at a time, fold 3 sides of dough over filling to create triangle shape, overlapping dough at corners and leaving small window of filling exposed. Gently press corners to seal and press any cracked edges back together. (If dough becomes too fragile to work with, return briefly to refrigerator.)
Bake cookies until evenly golden brown around edges, 16 to 20 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Repeat process with second sheet of rolled dough.
Gather dough scraps into rough disk shape and reroll between parchment to ⅛-inch thickness. Repeat cutting, filling, shaping, and baking with rerolled dough; rerolled dough should yield 4 to 8 additional cookies. (Do not reroll scraps a second time.) Let cookies cool completely before serving. (Cooled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.)

Whisk egg, espresso powder, salt, and vanilla together in small bowl. Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, and baking soda together in second bowl.
Process sugar in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add butter and process until uniform mass forms and no large pieces of butter are visible, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add egg mixture and process until smooth and paste-like, about 10 seconds. Add flour mixture and process until no dry flour remains but mixture remains crumbly, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Turn out dough onto counter; knead gently by hand until smooth, about 10 seconds. Divide dough in half. Place 1 piece of dough in center of large sheet of parchment paper and press into 7 by 9-inch oval. Place second large sheet of parchment over dough and roll dough into 10 by 14-inch oval of even ⅛-inch thickness. Transfer dough with parchment to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat pressing and rolling with second piece of dough, then stack on top of first piece on sheet. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1 1/2 hours (or freeze for 30 minutes). (Rolled dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line rimless cookie sheet with parchment. Working with 1 piece of rolled dough, gently peel off top layer of parchment. Replace parchment, loosely covering dough. (Peeling off parchment and then returning it will make cutting and removing cookies easier.) Turn over dough and parchment and gently peel off and discard second piece of parchment. Using cookie cutter, cut dough into shapes. Transfer shapes to prepared cookie sheet, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. Bake until cookies show slight resistance to touch, 14 to 17 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat cutting and baking with remaining dough. (Dough scraps can be patted together, rerolled, and chilled once before baking.)
Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip all ingredients on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed.

Divide dough into sixteen 2½-ounce (71-gram) portions, about ¼ cup each. Divide any remaining dough evenly among dough portions. Roll dough portions between your wet hands to make dough balls.
 Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 8 balls per sheet. Using your hand, flatten dough balls to ¾-inch thickness.

Belgian Spice Cookies (Speculoos) with Almonds,By_Andrew Janjigian_Comments,4,20,"1¼ hours, plus 1½ hours resting and 20 minutes cooling",Makes 32 cookies,12,"By
Andrew Janjigian
Whisk flour, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in bowl. Using pencil and ruler, draw 10 by 12-inch rectangle in center of each of 2 large sheets of parchment paper, crisscrossing lines at corners. (Use crisscrosses to help line up top and bottom sheets as dough is rolled.)
Process sugar in food processor for 30 seconds (some grains will be smaller than granulated sugar; others will be larger). Add butter and process until uniform mass forms and no large pieces of butter are visible, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add egg and process until smooth and paste-like, about 10 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add flour mixture and process until no dry flour remains but mixture remains crumbly, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Transfer dough to bowl and knead gently with spatula until uniform and smooth, about 10 seconds. Place 1 piece of parchment on counter with pencil side facing down (you should be able to see rectangle through paper). Place dough in center of marked rectangle and press into 6 by 9-inch rectangle. Place second sheet of parchment over dough, with pencil side facing up, so dough is in center of marked rectangle. Using pencil marks as guide, use rolling pin and bench scraper to shape dough into 10 by 12-inch rectangle of even thickness. Gently peel off top layer of parchment. Sprinkle almonds evenly over surface of dough. Using rolling pin, gently press almonds into dough. Return parchment to dough. Flip dough so almonds face down and transfer dough with parchment to rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1½ hours (or freeze for 30 minutes). (Rolled dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line 2 rimless baking sheets with parchment. Transfer chilled dough to counter. Gently peel off top layer of parchment from dough. Using fluted pastry wheel (or sharp knife or pizza cutter) and ruler, trim off rounded edges of dough that extend over marked edges of 10 by 12-inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into 8 equal strips about 1¼ inches wide. Cut each strip crosswise into 4 equal pieces about 3 inches long. Transfer cookies to prepared sheets, spacing them at least ½ inch apart. Bake until cookies are lightly and evenly browned, 30 to 32 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets, about 20 minutes. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 weeks.)

Line 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with 2 pieces of plastic wrap, perpendicular to one another, leaving 3-inch overhang all around. Whisk flour, cardamom, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl; set aside.
Heat butter and water in small saucepan over low heat until butter is just melted; do not boil. Transfer butter mixture to large bowl and let cool to 150 degrees, about 5 minutes.
Stir orange zest and almond extract into butter mixture until evenly combined, then stir in sugar and almonds. (Some of sugar will melt; this is OK.) Using rubber spatula, stir in flour mixture until evenly combined and no dry flour remains.
Transfer dough to prepared pan and press into even layer using metal spatula. Fold overhanging plastic wrap over dough and wrap tightly. Freeze dough until well chilled and firm, at least 1 hour. (Tightly wrapped dough can be frozen for up to 2 months.)
Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove dough from pan using plastic overhang and discard plastic. Let dough thaw slightly, about 10 minutes. Using large serrated knife or chef's knife, slice dough as thin as possible (about ⅛ inch thick) to make 30 cookies (this will use about half of dough). Place cookies 1 inch apart on prepared sheets, 15 cookies per sheet. Wrap remaining dough in plastic and return to freezer.
Bake cookies until edges are just golden, 8 to 10 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely; they will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining dough or keep remaining dough frozen until ready to slice and bake. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.)

 Process flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until evenly combined, about 5 seconds. Add butter and process until mixture resembles crumbly cookie dough, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to counter (do not wash food processor) and knead until uniform dough forms. Transfer to large sheet of parchment paper and press to ½-inch thickness. Cover with second piece of parchment and roll dough into 11 by 15-inch rectangle (it's fine to trim and patch dough to achieve correct dimensions). Remove top piece of parchment and use 1½-inch round cutter to cut 60 circles (A). Leaving circles and trim in place, replace top parchment and transfer to cookie sheet. Freeze until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.
Whisk 2 cups milk and ¾ cup sugar together in small saucepan. Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds. Add vanilla bean and seeds to milk mixture. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm. Use fork to whisk eggs together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Fit pastry bag with ½-inch round tip.
Bring remaining 1 cup milk, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, butter, water, and salt to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Off heat, stir in flour until incorporated. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly and using smearing motion, until mixture registers between 175 and 180 degrees, about 5 minutes.
Transfer hot mixture to food processor (do not wash saucepan) and process for 10 seconds to cool slightly. With processor running, add beaten eggs in steady stream and process until incorporated, about 30 seconds (do not wash liquid measuring cup). Scrape down sides of bowl and continue to process until smooth, thick, sticky paste forms, about 30 seconds. (B).
Weigh out 1¼ pounds of paste for choux buns. Transfer to prepared pastry bag, twist top closed, and set aside. Discard vanilla bean (or reserve for other use) and transfer warm milk mixture to now-empty 2-cup liquid measuring cup. With processor running, add milk mixture in steady stream to remaining choux paste and process until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and continue to process until mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds longer.
Transfer pastry cream to now-empty saucepan, scraping processor bowl well. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly and being sure to scrape corners of saucepan, until mixture has consistency of thick pudding, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; scrape corners of saucepan with spatula and whisk again until smooth. Transfer to large wide bowl and whisk to remove any remaining lumps. Press lightly greased parchment paper directly on surface and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.
Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees convection. Lightly spray 2 rimmed baking sheets with vegetable oil spray and dust lightly and evenly with flour. Rap edge of sheets firmly on counter to dislodge and discard excess flour. Using 1½-inch round cutter, mark 30 circles on each baking sheet. Pipe choux paste into mounds on prepared sheets, using circles as guide and stopping just short of the edge of each circle (C). Place 1 frozen craquelin disk on top of each mound (D). Bake until golden brown and firm, about 20 minutes.
Remove sheets from oven and use paring knife to poke ¼-inch hole into bottom of each bun to release steam. Return choux aux craquelin to oven, turn off oven, and prop open oven door with handle of wooden spoon. Let dry until centers are mostly dry and surfaces are crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool completely.
Fit clean pastry bag with ¼-inch round tip. In large bowl, whisk cream to stiff peaks. Gently whisk pastry cream until smooth. Fold pastry cream into whipped cream until combined. Transfer one-third of mixture to pastry bag. To fill choux aux craquelin, insert pastry tip ½ inch into opening and squeeze gently until cream just starts to appear around opening, about 1 tablespoon cream per bun (E). Refill bag as needed.
Set up assembly station near stove (F): Tape 9-inch parchment round to cardboard cake round and tape cardboard round to turntable or platter; fill medium saucepan with water and bring to boil (for cleaning caramel-coated utensils); place long-handled kitchen spoon, 2 forks, and pair of tongs (to safely retrieve anything that falls into hot caramel) on plate. Fill bowl with ice water (for unlikely event of caramel burn).
Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat, without stirring, until sugar has dissolved, 6 to 10 minutes. Continue to cook until mixture is amber-colored, 8 to 10 minutes (if mixture is coloring unevenly, gently swirl saucepan). Slide saucepan off heat and allow caramel to cool to consistency of warm honey, about 4 minutes. Adjust heat to lowest setting and return saucepan to burner to keep warm.
Arrange 10 buns in circle, so they are touching one another, on cake round. Remove 3 buns from circle (G). With long-handled spoon, drizzle about 2 teaspoons caramel onto cake round where buns were (H). Working quickly, return spoon to saucepan and place buns on drizzled caramel (I). Repeat with remaining buns until all 10 buns are attached to round.
Drizzle about 1 tablespoon caramel over about one-quarter of bun circle. Arrange 3 buns on hot caramel, positioning them about ¼ inch toward middle of circle, pressing gently and holding buns in place until caramel cools slightly, about 15 seconds (J). Repeat until second layer has circle of 9 buns. Continue to build 6 more layers, using one fewer bun for each successive layer and always placing buns about ¼ inch toward middle of circle to achieve cone shape.
For second-to-last row, place 1 bun flat side up on counter and drizzle with caramel. Carefully place second bun flat side down on hot caramel. Let cool slightly, about 1 minute. Drizzle top of croquembouche with caramel and stand double bun vertically on top. Drizzle top of double bun with caramel and stand last bun vertically on top. Slide caramel off heat and let cool slightly.
Holding 2 forks back-to-back, dip into caramel to coat both sets of tines. Drizzle caramel around croquembouche, turning turntable, if using, to cover with thin caramel strands (K). Repeat until croquembouche is coated to your desired appearance. If desired, drizzle about 1 tablespoon caramel onto parchment paper to make decorative topper (star, spiral, etc.). Let cool until solid, about 5 minutes. Make slit in top bun and insert topper, if using, shortly before presenting. Serve within 2 hours. To serve, use tongs to pluck individual buns from structure; if necessary, use kitchen shears to cut caramel between buns. (Leftovers may be refrigerated for up to 2 days, but buns will soften and caramel will become sticky.)

Place 1½ cups sugar, hazelnuts, and cream cheese in large bowl. Place remaining 1/3 cup sugar in shallow baking dish or pie plate and set aside. Heat butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, swirling pan frequently, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour butter over sugar and cream cheese mixture; whisk to combine (some small lumps of cream cheese will remain but will smooth out later). Whisk in oil until incorporated. Add egg and milk; continue to whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and mix with rubber spatula until soft homogeneous dough forms.
Divide dough into 24 equal pieces, about 2 tablespoons each. Using hands, roll dough into balls. Working in batches, roll balls in reserved sugar to coat and set on prepared baking sheet, 12 dough balls per sheet. Using bottom of drinking glass, flatten dough balls until 2 inches in diameter. Sprinkle tops evenly with 4 teaspoons reserved sugar (2 teaspoons per tray), discarding any remaining sugar.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 13 by 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, allowing excess to overhang pan edges. Spray pan with cooking spray. Process flour, 11/4 cups almonds, granulated sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Add butter and pulse mixture until it resembles coarse meal (some pea-sized pieces of butter will remain), about twenty 1-second pulses.
Transfer 1/2 cup flour mixture to small bowl and set aside. Press remaining flour mixture firmly and evenly into bottom of prepared baking pan (see photo 1). Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, toss remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar with reserved flour mixture. Set aside.
While crust is baking, remove blade from food processor and wipe out workbowl. Pulse peaches and preserves in food processor until mixture has 1/4-inch chunks, about five 1-second pulses (if larger chunks remain, scrape down sides and pulse 2 more times). Cook peach mixture in large nonstick skillet over high heat until thickened and jam-like, about 10 minutes. Off heat, add pinch salt, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Pour mixture over hot crust.
Using fingers, pinch reserved flour mixture to create dime-sized clumps (see photo 2) and sprinkle over peaches. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup almonds over top and bake until almonds are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours. Using foil overhang, lift from pan and cut into 24 squares. Squares are best served on day they are baked because the crust can become soggy with time. (See below for reheating instructions.)
To revive, simply place leftover squares side by side (with no spaces in between the squares) on a baking sheet and heat in a 350-degree oven until the bottoms are crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool back to room temperature before eating.

Stir all ingredients together in bowl until evenly combined; set aside.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, cream cheese, and salt on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add egg and vanilla and continue to beat until well incorporated, about 1 minute longer. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until dough is uniform, about 1 minute. Divide dough in half. Transfer each half to sheet of plastic wrap, form into 6-inch disk, wrap tightly, and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Unwrap 1 dough disk, place in center of large piece of parchment, and cover with second large piece of parchment. Roll dough into 12-inch round of uniform ⅛-inch thickness, occasionally flipping dough and gently peeling off and replacing parchment to avoid creases. Refrigerate rolled dough sheet between parchment while repeating rolling (between parchment) with remaining dough disk.
Peel off top piece of parchment from 1 rolled dough sheet. Using 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into 11 or 12 rounds and space evenly on prepared sheet. Dollop 1 heaping teaspoon filling in center of each round. Working with 1 round at a time, fold 3 sides of dough over filling to create triangle shape, overlapping dough at corners and leaving small window of filling exposed. Gently press corners to seal and press any cracked edges back together. (If dough becomes too fragile to work with, return briefly to refrigerator.) Dip your fingertip in water and moisten folded flaps of dough, then sprinkle and press about ¼ teaspoon sesame seeds onto edges of each cookie.
Bake cookies until evenly golden brown around edges, 16 to 20 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Repeat process with second sheet of rolled dough.
Gather dough scraps into rough disk shape and reroll between parchment to ⅛-inch thickness. Repeat cutting, filling, shaping, and baking with rerolled dough; rerolled dough should yield 4 to 8 additional cookies. (Do not reroll scraps a second time.) Let cookies cool completely before serving. (Cooled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.)

America's Test Kitchen
Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat (or in medium microwave-safe bowl, on medium power for about 30 seconds). Add cocoa powder and espresso powder; stir until mixture forms smooth paste. Set aside to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix remaining 16 tablespoons butter, sugar, salt, and cooled cocoa mixture on high speed until well combined and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping sides of mixing bowl once or twice with rubber spatula. Add yolks and mint extract and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape sides of bowl. With mixer running on low, add flour in three additions, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding the next and scraping bowl after each addition. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 5 seconds. Turn dough onto counter; divide into three 4-inch disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough is firm yet malleable, 45 to 60 minutes. (Alternatively, shape dough into log 2 inches in diameter and about 12 inches long; use parchment paper or plastic wrap to roll into neat cylinder. Chill until very firm and cold, at least 1 hour.)
Roll out 1 dough disk between 2 large sheets parchment paper to even thickness of 3/16 inch. (If dough becomes soft and sticky, slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and rechill until firm, about 10 minutes.) Peel parchment from one side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s); using thin metal spatula, place shapes on parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Gather dough scraps and chill. (For log-shaped dough, simply slice cookies 1/4 inch thick and place on parchment-lined baking sheets.)
Bake until cookies show slight resistance to touch, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time; if cookies begin to darken on edges, they are overbaked. Repeat with second and third portions of rolled dough. Cool for 5 minutes, then, using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack; allow to cool completely. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining dough disks and scraps, rerolling scraps just once.
For Glaze: In bowl set over pot of simmering water, melt chocolate with butter and whisk until smooth. Remove bowl from pot, add corn syrup and vanilla, and mix until smooth and shiny. Use back of spoon to spread scant 1 teaspoon glaze almost to edge of each cookie. (If necessary, reheat to increase fluidity of glaze.) Allow glazed cookies to dry at least 20 minutes. Drizzle melted white chocolate chips over glazed cookes. Let dry at least 20 minutes before serving.

America's Test Kitchen
In medium skillet set over medium heat, toast almonds, cinnamon, and cayenne until fragrant, about 3 minutes; set aside to cool. In food processor fitted with metal blade, process cooled mixture until very fine, about 15 seconds. Set aside.
Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cocoa powder and espresso powder; stir until mixture forms smooth paste. Set aside to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix remaining 16 tablespoons butter, sugar, salt, and cooled cocoa mixture on high speed until well combined and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping sides of mixing bowl once or twice with rubber spatula. Add yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape sides of bowl. Whisk nut/spice mixture into flour. With mixer running on low, add flour in three additions, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding next and scraping bowl after each addition. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 5 seconds. Shape into dough log, 2 inches in diameter and about 12 inches long; use parchment paper or plastic wrap to roll into neat cylinder. Chill until very firm and cold, at least 1 hour.
Roll chilled log in turbinado sugar. Slice cookies 1/4 inch thick and place on parchment-lined baking sheets.
Bake until cookies show slight resistance to touch (see photo below), 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time; if cookies begin to darken on edges, they have overbaked. Cool for 5 minutes, then, using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack; cool completely. Decorate as desired.
For Glaze: Melt bittersweet chocolate with butter and whisk until smooth. Add corn syrup and vanilla extract and mix until smooth and shiny. Use back of spoon to spread scant 1 teaspoon glaze almost to edge of each cookie. (If necessary, reheat to prolong fluidity of glaze.) Allow glazed cookies to dry at least 20 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimless baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, cardamom, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stop mixer. Add flour and mix on low speed until mixture comes together in crumbly dough, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer to work surface and knead gently until dough forms smooth ball.
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Gently roll and pinch each piece into 14-inch log (if dough cracks, pinch it back together). Arrange logs lengthwise on prepared sheet. Press your index finger along length of 1 log to create trough that is ¾ inch wide and ¼ inch to ⅓ inch deep, using fingers of your other hand to mold sides of trough. Repeat with remaining logs.
Whisk preserves and lemon juice in bowl until smooth. Transfer mixture to piping bag fitted with ¼-inch round tip and pipe evenly among troughs. Bake until logs are lightly browned and firm to touch, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Cool on sheet until just warm to touch.
Gently slide logs into center of sheet until touching. Whisk confectioners' sugar and water in small bowl until smooth. (If mixture is too thick to drizzle, whisk in more water, ½ teaspoon at a time.) Using spoon, drizzle icing over cookies. Let sit until icing is set, 25 to 30 minutes.
Run thin spatula under 1 log to release from parchment. Carefully transfer log to cutting board. Using sharp chef's knife at 45-degree angle, trim ½ inch from each end of log and discard trim. Slice remaining length on diagonal into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining logs. Serve. (Store cookies at room temperature for up to 6 days.)

For the gingerbread people: Add flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, and salt to food processor and lock lid into place. Turn on processor and process until combined, about 10 seconds.
Stop processor and remove lid. Add melted butter, molasses, and 1 tablespoon milk and lock lid back into place. Turn on processor and process until soft and crumbly dough forms and no streaks of flour remain, about 20 seconds.
Stop processor, remove lid, and carefully remove processor blade (ask an adult for help). Use rubber spatula to scrape dough onto clean counter. Knead dough until it comes together, about 20 seconds (see photo, “Step-by-Step: How to Knead Cookie Dough,” below).
Lay sheet of plastic wrap on counter. Place dough in center of plastic and flatten dough into 8-­inch circle. Wrap dough tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours. (If dough has been refrigerated for more than 1 hour, be sure to let dough sit on counter for 15 minutes before rolling out.)
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove dough from refrigerator and discard plastic. Place dough in center of second large sheet of parchment. Place third large sheet of parchment on top of dough. Use rolling pin to roll dough into 11-­inch circle (about ¼ inch thick), rolling dough between parchment (see photo, “Step-by-Step: How to Roll Cookie Dough,” below). 
Peel off top sheet of parchment. Use cookie cutter to cut dough into gingerbread people. Use spatula to transfer shapes to parchment-­lined baking sheet, spaced about ½ inch apart.
Gather dough scraps and place them in center of large piece of parchment, and place another piece of parchment on top. Repeat rolling and cutting steps with dough scraps until you have 12 cookies. Discard remaining dough scraps.
Place baking sheet in oven. Bake until cookies are slightly puffy and just set around edges, 9 to 11 minutes.
Use oven mitts to remove baking sheet from oven and place on cooling rack (ask an adult for help). Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes.
Use spatula to transfer cookies directly to cooling rack. Let cookies cool completely, about 30 minutes.
For the glaze and decorations: While cookies are cooling, in medium bowl, combine confectioners’ sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, softened cream cheese, and food coloring (if using). Use clean rubber spatula to stir until very smooth.

America's Test Kitchen
In food processor workbowl fitted with steel blade, process flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and baking soda until combined, about 10 seconds. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture and process until mixture is sandy and resembles very fine meal, about 15 seconds. With machine running, gradually add molasses and milk; process until dough is evenly moistened and forms soft mass, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, in bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, stir together flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and baking soda at low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Stop mixer and add butter pieces; mix at medium-low speed until mixture is sandy and resembles fine meal, about 1 1/2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and, with mixer running, gradually add molasses and milk; mix until dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds.
Scrape dough onto work surface; divide in half. Working with one portion of dough at a time, roll 1/4-inch thick between two large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving dough sandwiched between parchment layers, stack on cookie sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate dough 2 hours or overnight.)
Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Remove one dough sheet from freezer; place on work surface. Peel off top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut dough into 5-inch gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread cookies, transferring shapes to parchment-lined cookie sheets with wide metal spatula, spacing them 3/4 inch apart; set scraps aside. Repeat with remaining dough until cookie sheets are full. Bake cookies until set in centers and dough barely retains imprint when touched very gently with fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes, rotating cookie sheets front to back and switching positions top to bottom halfway through baking time. Do not overbake. Cool cookies on sheets 2 minutes, then remove with wide metal spatula to wire rack; cool to room temperature.
Gather scraps; repeat rolling, cutting, and baking in steps 2 and four

Reduce speed to low and, with mixer running, gradually add molasses and milk; mix until dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds.
Scrape dough onto work surface; divide in half. Working with one portion of dough at a time, roll 1/4-inch thick between two large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving dough sandwiched between parchment layers, stack on cookie sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate dough 2 hours or overnight.)
Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Remove one dough sheet from freezer; place on work surface. Peel off top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut dough into 5-inch gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread cookies, transferring shapes to parchment-lined cookie sheets with wide metal spatula, spacing them 3/4 inch apart; set scraps aside. Repeat with remaining dough until cookie sheets are full. Bake cookies until set in centers and dough barely retains imprint when touched very gently with fingertip, 8 to 11 minutes, rotating cookie sheets front to back and switching positions top to bottom halfway through baking time. Do not overbake. Cool cookies on sheets 2 minutes, then remove with wide metal spatula to wire rack; cool to room temperature.

America's Test Kitchen
Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over medium heat (or in medium microwave-safe bowl, on medium power for about 30 seconds). Add cocoa powder and espresso powder; stir until mixture forms smooth paste. Set aside to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.
In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix remaining 16 tablespoons butter, sugar, zest, salt, and cooled cocoa mixture on high speed until well combined and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping sides of mixing bowl once or twice with rubber spatula. Add yolks and brandy and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape sides of bowl. With mixer running on low, add flour in three additions, waiting until each addition is incorporated before adding the next and scraping bowl after each addition. Continue to mix until dough forms cohesive ball, about 5 seconds. Turn dough onto counter; divide into three 4-inch disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough is firm yet malleable, 45 to 60 minutes. (Alternatively, shape dough into log 2 inches in diameter and about 12 inches long; use parchment paper or plastic wrap to roll into neat cylinder. Chill until very firm and cold, at least 1 hour.)
Roll out 1 dough disk between 2 large sheets parchment paper to even thickness of 3/16 inch. (If dough becomes soft and sticky, slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and rechill until firm, about 10 minutes.) Peel parchment from one side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s); using thin metal spatula, place shapes on parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Gather dough scraps and chill. (For log-shaped dough, simply slice cookies 1/4 inch thick and place on parchment-lined baking sheets.)
Bake until cookies show slight resistance to touch, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time; if cookies begin to darken on edges, they are overbaked. Repeat with second and third portions of rolled dough. Cool for 5 minutes, then, using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack; allow to cool completely. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining dough disks and scraps, rerolling scraps just once. Spread cooled cookies with Chocolate-Brandy Glaze, (see below).
For Glaze: In bowl set over pot of simmering water, melt chocolate with butter and whisk until smooth. Remove bowl from pot, add corn syrup and brandy, and mix until smooth and shiny. Use back of spoon to spread scant 1 teaspoon glaze almost to edge of each cookie. (If necessary, reheat to increase fluidity of glaze.) Allow glazed cookies to dry at least 20 minutes.

America's Test Kitchen
Adjust two oven racks to the upper and lower-middle positions, and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Process the toasted nuts, granulated sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg in a food processor to a fine meal, 30 to 60 seconds, stopping and scraping the sides as needed. Add the orange and lemon zest, and continue to process until combined, about 15 seconds; set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, and salt together; set aside. In a large bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar together using an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs and vanilla, and continue to mix until incorporated. Add the flour mixture and continue to mix until combined, about 1 minute. Add the ground nut mixture and continue to mix until evenly combined (the mixer bowl will be very full).
Using two greased soupspoons (or a greased 1 3/4-inch spring-loaded ice cream scoop), portion 2-tablespoon-sized mounds of dough, spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart, onto the baking sheets (each sheet should hold about 10 cookies and you should have enough dough left for another sheet of cookies).
Bake the cookies until the edges are firm and the tops are puffed with tiny cracks, 13 to 18 minutes, rotating and switching the sheets halfway through the baking time. Set the cookies aside to cool on the baking sheets until set, about 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Reline one of the baking sheets with parchment paper, portion out the remaining dough into cookies, and bake as directed.
When the cookies are cool, whisk the confectioners' sugar and milk together in a medium bowl until smooth and incorporated. (If the glaze begins to dry out as it sits, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to loosen.) Using a pastry brush, brush a thin layer of the glaze over the tops of the cookies, and let sit until the glaze has set, about 10 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimless baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, cinnamon, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stop mixer. Add flour and mix on low speed until mixture comes together in crumbly dough, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer to work surface and knead gently until dough forms smooth ball.
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Gently roll and pinch each piece into 14-inch log (if dough cracks, pinch it back together). Arrange logs lengthwise on prepared sheet. Press your index finger along length of 1 log to create trough that is ¾ inch wide and ¼ inch to ⅓ inch deep, using fingers of your other hand to mold sides. Repeat with remaining logs.
Whisk jam and lemon juice in bowl until smooth. Transfer mixture to piping bag fitted with ¼-inch round tip and pipe evenly among troughs. Bake until logs are lightly browned and firm to touch, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Cool on sheet until just warm to touch.
Gently slide logs into center of sheet until touching. Whisk confectioners' sugar and water in small bowl until smooth. (If mixture is too thick to drizzle, whisk in more water ½ teaspoon at a time.) Using spoon, drizzle icing over cookies. Let sit until icing is set, 25 to 30 minutes.
Run thin spatula under 1 log to release from parchment. Carefully transfer log to cutting board. Using sharp chef's knife at 45-degree angle, trim ½ inch from each end of log and discard trim. Slice remaining length on diagonal into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining logs. Serve. (Store cookies at room temperature for up to 6 days.)

Add flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula or wooden spoon until well combined (dough will be loose). Let dough rest until firm, about 5 minutes.
Shape dough into rough 8 by 5-inch rectangle. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
Sift espresso powder, cocoa, confectioners' sugar, and milk powder through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl. Cut chilled dough into rough ¾-inch pieces. Add to espresso-cocoa mixture and toss until pieces are evenly coated. Transfer pieces to counter, shaking excess espresso-cocoa mixture back into bowl (do not discard). Divide dough pieces into 2 piles.
Working with 1 pile, firmly squeeze one-quarter of pieces together to form dough ball with streaks of espresso mixture throughout (do not knead dough). Repeat with remaining three-quarters of dough to form 3 more balls. Squeeze and press dough balls together to form rough 8-inch log. Continue to shape and roll log until 1½ inches in diameter and about 9 inches long. Flatten log slightly on 2 sides, until it is 1 inch tall and has oval shape. Repeat with remaining dough pile to form second log.

Unwrap 1 dough disk, place in center of large piece of parchment, and cover with second large piece of parchment. Roll dough into 12-inch round of uniform 1⁄8-inch thickness, occasionally flipping dough and gently peeling off and replacing parchment to avoid creases. Refrigerate rolled dough sheet between parchment while repeating rolling (between parchment) with remaining dough disk.

In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix oat flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, sugar, salt, and pistachios on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. Add butter to dry ingredients and continue to mix on low speed until dough just forms and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place upside-down (grooved edge should be at top) collar of 9- or 9½-inch springform pan on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet (do not use springform pan bottom). Press dough into collar in even ½-inch-thick layer, smoothing top of dough with back of spoon. Place 2-inch biscuit cutter in center of dough and cut out center. Place extracted round alongside springform collar on baking sheet and replace cutter in center of dough. Open springform collar, but leave it in place.
Bake shortbread 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees. Continue to bake until edges turn pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove baking sheet from oven; turn off oven. Remove springform pan collar; use chef’s knife to score surface of shortbread into 16 even wedges, cutting halfway through shortbread. Using wooden skewer, poke 8 to 10 holes in each wedge. Return shortbread to oven and prop door open with handle of wooden spoon, leaving 1-inch gap at top. Allow shortbread to dry in turned-off oven until pale golden in center (shortbread should be firm but giving to touch), about 1 hour.
Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool shortbread to room temperature, at least 2 hours. Cut shortbread at scored marks to separate. Meanwhile, melt 8 ounces (227 grams) bittersweet chocolate in small heatproof bowl set over pan of almost-simmering water, stirring once or twice, until smooth. Remove from heat; stir in additional 2 ounces (57 grams) finely chopped bittersweet chocolate until smooth. Carefully dip base of each wedge in chocolate, allowing chocolate to come halfway up cookie. Scrape off excess with finger and place on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 15 minutes and serve.

For the cookies: Whisk flour blend, salt, and xanthan gum together in bowl; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg, yolk, and vanilla and beat until well combined. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until flour is incorporated and dough comes together, 2 to 4 minutes. Divide dough into 4 even pieces. Press each piece into 4-inch disk, wrap each disk in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until dough is firm, about 1 hour. (Dough can be refrigerated up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks; defrost frozen dough in refrigerator before using.)
Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll 1/8 inch thick between 2 large sheets of parchment paper. Peel parchment from 1 side of dough and place back on dough. Flip dough over and repeat with second sheet of parchment. Slide dough, still between parchment, onto baking sheet and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 sheet of dough at a time, peel parchment from 1 side of dough and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters; space cookies 1½ inches apart on prepared sheets. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until firm to touch and edges are just beginning to brown, 12 to 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. (Dough scraps can be patted together, chilled, and rerolled once.) Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cookies cool to room temperature before glazing.
For the glaze: Whisk cream cheese and 2 tablespoons milk together in medium bowl until no lumps remain. Add sugar and whisk until smooth, adding remaining 1 tablespoon milk as needed until glaze is thin enough to spread easily. Using back of spoon, drizzle or spread scant teaspoon of glaze onto each cooled cookie. Allow glazed cookies to dry at least 30 minutes. (Cookies are best eaten on day they are baked, but they can be stored in airtight container for up to 2 days.)

America's Test Kitchen
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Using ruler and permanent marker, draw two 8 by 3-inch rectangles, spaced 4 inches apart, on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, ink side down.
Pulse 1 cup hazelnuts in food processor until coarsely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses; transfer to bowl and set aside. Process remaining 1/4 cup hazelnuts in food processor until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Add flour, lavender, baking powder, and salt; process to combine, about 15 seconds. Transfer flour mixture to bowl. Process 2 eggs in now-empty food processor until lightened in color and almost doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar until thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Add melted butter, lemon zest, water, and vanilla; process until combined, about 10 seconds. Transfer egg mixture to medium bowl. Sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg mixture and, using spatula, gently fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and chopped hazelnuts and gently fold until just combined.
Divide batter in half. Using floured hands, form each half into 8 by 3-inch rectangle, using lines on parchment as guide. Spray each loaf lightly with oil spray. Using rubber spatula lightly coated with oil spray, smooth tops and sides of rectangles. Gently brush tops of loaves with egg white wash. Bake until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.
Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes. Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Lay slices, cut side down, about 1/4 inch apart on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking. Let cool completely before serving. Biscotti can be stored in airtight container for up to 1 month.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.
Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour blend, granulated sugar, ground ginger, salt, and xanthan gum on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. (Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water as needed if dough appears dry.) Set aside ½ cup mixture for topping. Press remaining mixture evenly into prepared pan using bottom of greased measuring cup. Bake until edges begin to brown, 14 to 18 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.
Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, walnuts, and oats into reserved dough. Combine preserves, crystallized ginger, and lemon zest and juice in separate bowl. Spread fig preserve mixture evenly over hot crust, then sprinkle with hazelnut-size clumps of oat topping. Bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 22 to 25 minutes.
Let bars cool completely in pan on wire rack, 1 to 2 hours. Using foil overhang, remove bars from pan. Cut into 16 pieces and serve. (Bars can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; crust and streusel will soften.)
