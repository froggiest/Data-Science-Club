You can shape the cookie dough into donuts in one of two ways. Method 1) Use a small round biscuit cutter to punch a hole in the center of the flattened dough. Place the donut hole back into the mixing bowl to be used for more cookies. This method is easier when you spray the biscuit cutter with non-stick spray first.
Method 2) Press the top and bottom center of the flattened dough with your thumb and forefinger until you create a hole. Use your hands to pull the hole open wider, until it's about 2-2.5"" wide. Place shaped donut cookies on the parchment lined cookie sheet, repeating process until you have 6-8 cookies on your sheet.

Place the 12 marshmallow twists in the freezer to firm up a bit while you make the cookies.
In a large bowl combine the sugar cookie mix, butter, and egg. Mix until a soft dough forms.
Divide the dough into 12 portions, weighing just under 2 ounces each, and roll into balls. Make an indention with your thumb in the center of each dough ball. (This will help when we later place our marshmallows in the centers.)
Place 6 dough balls about 3 inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes- the cookies will be underbaked still. Remove baking sheet from oven and carefully press 1 marshmallow twist into the center of each cookie. Marshmallows should go all the way through the cookie, hitting the baking sheet.
Return cookies to oven and bake for another 2-3 minutes, or until the marshmallows are puffy and cookies are very lightly golden. (Cookies will continue to set up after they’re removed from the oven. Avoid overbaking to prevent dry cookies. )
Remove baking sheet from the oven and allow cookies to cool for 3 minutes. Use the back of a spatula to gently press the marshmallow level with the tops of the cookies. Gently transfer to a wire rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before frosting.
Once cooled, frost cookies with about 2 tablespoons of frosting, covering up the magical marshmallow. Top with sprinkles.

Whisk the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl.
Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients little by little. Mix at low speed until well combined. Make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl so it is all mixed in.
Chill dough: Roll the dough onto a parchment sheet until the dough is 1/4” thick. Transfer to a pan and place the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Add some parchment paper onto your baking sheet and set aside.
Remove the sheet of dough from the fridge. Use cookie cutters to cut the cookie shapes and place them on a baking sheet.
Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Let them cool for at least an hour.
Marble Icing: Mix your powdered sugar, meringue powder, 3 tablespoons of water and vanilla with a standing mixer using a whisk attachment. Beat the icing ingredients together on high speed for about 2 minutes. Place a spoon or knife into the icing, and lift it up. It should drizzle down and smooth out in about 5 – 8 seconds. If it looks too thick, add a bit more water little by little because it could easily get too thin. If it's too thin, add a bit more powdered sugar. The icing should be about a flooding consistency (like honey, should be a little runny, but not watery.) 
Separate the frosting into three bowls and using a toothpick, add a drop of coloring onto it and swirl it on the white icing. If you are using two colors, repeat the same with another color in that bowl. You will notice the first color in this case, I used green, and as you swirl you will notice different shades across the icing. Continue by adding your second color onto the toothpick, in this case red, and do the same. Swirl it around the icing. ​​Keep in mind that the icing will harden quickly, so make sure to cover anything not being used right away.
Dip the whole top of the cookie in the royal icing mixture. Make sure all of the edges are covered. Lift the cookie carefully and let the extra icing drip off the cookie by holding it over the bowl. Place it on a cooling rack to set, but keep in mind some of the icing might drip a bit.
Continue to do it for the color you like in each of the bowls. In the other one, I only used blue coloring on the white icing, and the last one I only used red coloring.

Once it is hot, place one tablespoon of the dough in the waffle maker to create small-sized cookies. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until cooked fully in the center. If you like crispier cookies, cook a little longer. (Each waffle maker will be a little different so just make sure to keep a close eye on the first couple of cookies to make sure you know how long your waffle maker will take to get the cookie cooked the way you prefer.)
Remove the cookies from the waffle maker and place them on a cooling rack to cool and firm up a bit.
Place the chocolate chips in a microwaveable dish and microwave for 30 seconds. Stir and then microwave for another 15 seconds. Continue in 15-second intervals, stirring in between each interval until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Don’t overcook it!

Then puree the strawberry pieces using an immersion blender or food processor. Proceed to pour the strawberry puree into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium low and boil for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The mixture will reduce by half, starting out mine measured 1 ½ cups, then after reducing I had ¾ cups.
Once reduced, cool the puree in the fridge or freezer and then you can proceed with Strawberry Cookie recipe. This process takes about 30 minutes total and can be done up to a week ahead of time.
Prep: Get started by preheating the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cookie dough: In a medium size bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Then, add in the egg, vanilla extract, sour cream and ¼ cup of the strawberry puree.
Next, in a separate small bowl, gently whisk together the salt, baking soda and flour. Proceed to add the dry ingredients to butter mixture and mix to combine. 
Bake: Continue to scoop out 1.5 TBSP of dough and place on the parchment lined cookie sheet. You can use a medium cookie scoop to make this process faster. Place the cookies in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
Butter cream frosting: In a medium size bowl, whisk the butter for 30 seconds with an electric mixer. Then add in the rest of the strawberry puree and 1 cup of powder sugar. Mix on medium speed for 1 minute, then add in the vanilla extract and remaining powder sugar, 1 cup at a time, until you've reached your desired consistency.
After that, transfer the frosting to a piping bag with a closed star tip- I used a Wilton 2D. Begin piping in a tight circle in the middle of the cookie. Continue piping frosting in a circular motion until you reach the outside of the cookie. The frosting will set, but I recommend not stacking cookies that have been frosted with a rosette so that you don't squish them.

Roll dough: Making the tiny cookies: I tested out sizes and to make the mini cookies like the ones in my photos, you need only 1/2 teaspoon of dough for each cookie. Yep- just that small amount! There are 2 ways I found you can easily do this: The first is to spray a 1 tsp measuring spoon with non-stick spray and scoop out dough, then divide it in half. This actually works pretty well, you'll just have to re-spray the spoon after 4 or 5 scoops. The second way is to scoop out dough using a regular 1.5 TBSP cookie scoop. (I use this cookie scoop here) Then divide that scoop of dough in half, then divide those 2 halves in half (so now you have 4 mounds of dough). Now divide all those dough mounds in half- you'll end up with 8 pieces of dough.
Recipe yields 85-90 mini cookies (when you use 1/2 tsp of dough).

Cheesecake Stuffed Funfetti Cookies,Jessica & Nellie,"April 20, 2023",NA,NA,American,"Cookies, Dessert",Home_Cheesecake Cookies,Keyword: cheesecake stuffed funfetti cookies,30 minutes,17 minutes,NA,47 minutes,15 cookies,16,"Cheesecake filling: Using a 2” circle cookie cutter sprayed lightly with non-stick cooking spray, cut out 15 two-inch round pieces of cheesecake. These cheesecake bites should be 2” in diameter and no more than 1” tall. Anything larger than that won’t fit inside the cookies. Once you’ve cut out all 15 pieces, place these cheesecake bites on a small baking sheet and place them into the freezer.
Cookie dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, corn starch, baking soda and salt. Set the dry mixture aside for now.
In a separate large bowl, beat together the butter, granulated sugar and light brown sugar on high until well combined, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat the eggs and vanilla on high into the butter mixture until light and a bit fluffy (about 1 minute). Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add flour mixture into the wet mixture and beat on low just until combined . Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all ingredients are combined properly. Do not overmix.
Use a spatula to stir in ¾ cup of the sprinkles. Be sure to use a spatula for this step and not the electric beaters. Set the remaining ¼ cup of the sprinkles aside for now.
Stuff cookies: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using a 2-tablespoon sized cookie scoop, scoop balls of cookie dough onto the parchment lined baking sheet. These cookie dough balls will be about 35 grams each. There will be 30 balls of cookie dough.
Use your hands to roll a cookie dough scoop into a round ball then flatten that cookie dough ball. If the cookie dough is sticking to your hands, you can spray your hands lightly with non-stick baking spray. Don’t roll and flatten all the cookie dough scoops at once, just work on one cookie at a time.
Place a frozen cheesecake bite on top of that flattened cookie dough ball. Use your hands to shape the flattened cookie dough ball around the bottom half of the frozen cheesecake bite. You’ll end up with a half wrapped cheesecake bite. Only remove one cheesecake bite from the freezer at a time. We want these cheesecake bites to remain frozen until right before you wrap it in a cookie dough ball.
Flatten a second cookie dough ball and place this over the cookie dough wrapped cheesecake bite. It’s important to wrap the two cookie dough balls around the cheesecake bites one at a time so you’re able to get the dough wrapped tightly around the cheesecake bites. Use your hands to form the top flattened cookie dough ball around the wrapped cheesecake bite to form one large stuffed cookie (be sure to keep the cheesecake facing up and the crust at the bottom of the cookie). Be sure to properly seal the two cookie dough pieces together around the cheesecake by rolling gently with your hands. The large raw cookies should be nice round balls. Repeat these steps with the rest of the cheesecake bites and cookies – working on one at a time.
Decorate & freeze: Place the remaining ¼ cup sprinkles on the baking sheet and press the tops of the raw cookies lightly into the sprinkles.
You’ll have a total of 15 large stuffed cookies on the baking tray. The cookies can be close together for this step but not touching or they’ll stick together once in the freezer. Place the tray of unbaked cookies in freezer for 15 minutes. Freezing the cookies before baking helps to prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. If the cookies spread too much during baking, it could expose the cheesecake bite in the middle.
Bake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper, take some cookies out of the freezer then place those cookies on the baking sheet. Cookies should be at least 3 inches from each other on the baking sheet to allow a little space for spreading. It is important to only bake one tray of cookies at a time to ensure an even baking temperature for all cookies. Leave the rest of the cookies in the freezer until you are ready to bake them.
Place one tray of cookies into the oven to bake. Bake each tray of cookies for 16-17 minutes. The baked cookies will look slightly undercooked but they’ll continue to bake on the hot tray after you remove them from the oven. Do not over bake or the cookies will be dry and crispy on the sides.
Let cookies cool for 10 minutes on the hot baking tray before removing to wire rack to cool completely. Repeat the baking for the second tray of cookies.

Once they have mixed well, place the dough into a large ziplocked bag and place in the refrigerator. Chill for at least one hour, but if you have time you can chill overnight to let the flavors develop.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 335°F and line baking trays with parchment and set aside.
You can either roll the cookie dough into 1 inch balls & dip them in granulated sugar or roll the dough out to about ¼"" thickness on a floured surface and cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place the dough 2 inches apart on prepared tray.

Remove them from the oven and carefully place them on a cooling rack. Allow them to completely cool before frosting them.
Royal Icing: Place all the icing ingredients in a blender and mix for approximately 5 minutes. This makes a thicker consistency which will be used for the border of the cookie. Transfer about ⅓ of the icing to a piping bag. We use this (white frosting) for a dam to hold in the thinner frosting that you use to flood the cookie with (pink and purple). You can also make them the same color if you’d like.
Add about 2 TBSP- ¼ cup more water to the remaining icing in the blender. Blend until smooth. Transfer to bowls and add food coloring to create the colors you’d like.
Decorate: Using the thicker frosting (white), create a border around the cookie. Fill in with the thinner frosting (pink or purple). When filling in the cookies with icing, use a small amount of icing at first and spread it around. Using too much icing will cause the dam to break, so to speak! Use the thicker frosting (white) to create details in the cookie.

Melt for one minute at 50% power. Stir the wafers and coconut oil. Continue microwaving for 30 second increments at 50% power until fully melted and smooth. This will take between 3 and 5 minutes.
Pour the melted wafers into a piping bag. This step isn’t absolutely necessary, you can pour the melted wafers onto the cookie. I find that a piping bag helps with a more consistent pour and reduces waste of the melting wafers.
Place the wafers on a cooling rack and use a parchment-lined baking sheet to capture any dripping from the melted wafers. Starting at the top of the cookie, pour or pipe the melted wafers onto the cookie in a back and forth motion covering just two-thirds of the cookie.
Allow the melting wafers to drip off for just a minute. You don’t want the cookie to set before you add the sprinkles.
Decorate: Using the tweezers, push 2 of the candy eyeballs into the melted chocolate then place 2 of the flower-shaped sprinkles to resemble the feet.
Add 2 of the yellow hair sprinkles above the eyes, near the top and place the 2 orange sprinkles under the eyes to give you the beak.

Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together, then fold the flour mixture into the wet ingredients using a rubber spatula just until combined. Do not overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly combined.
Prepare 2 baking pans with parchment paper.
ASSEMBLE THE COOKIES: Use a medium or large cookie scoop to add a scoop per cookie onto the baking pan. Press down with the bottom of the cookie scooper, so you can make the center flat to place the Nutella onto the cookie. The diameter of the cookie dough should be bigger than the diameter of the frozen Nutella filling.
Take one frozen Nutella filling and place it on top of the cookie dough. Take another scoop of cookie dough and gently but firmly seal the filling inside with the bottom piece of cookie dough, encasing it in the dough making a ball.
Continue with the rest, until you have your 12 filled cookies. If you'd like, you can place a few more chocolate chips on top.

Then, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon mat.
Also, crush the graham crackers. The best way to get uniform crumbs that are fine enough is to crush them in the blender. I like to do about 6-7 graham crackers at a time. If you put too many graham crackers in the blender at once, it will be difficult for the blender to blend them all at once. Or you can use a ziplocked bag and rolling pin for this step as well.
Dough: Next, in a medium size bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, flour and baking powder, set aside. In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter and brown sugar together for 2-3 minutes. Then add in the egg whites from the two eggs and beat for another 1-2 minutes. Proceed to add the dry flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir just until combined.
Cream cheese filling: In another bowl, beat the soft cream cheese, egg yolks, sugar and vanilla extract together. Mix until smooth and well combined.
Assemble: Using a large cookie scoop (2 Tbsp),scoop out the cookie dough. Roll each scoop into a ball and place two inches apart on the prepared parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Use the palm of your hand to flatten each cookie dough ball a little bit (cookies should be about1/2″ thick). Then use your thumb to press an indentation in each cookie. Be careful not to press down too far into the cookie. After that, use a small spoon to scoop the cheesecake filling into each indentation.
Bake: Place the cookies in the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes. Once finished baking, let the cookies cool for about 4-5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Once the cookies are cooled, top with about ½ tsp raspberry pie filling per cookie. Refrigerate them until you are ready to serve.

Use a medium cookie scoop to portion out the dough and gently roll into balls. Place the balls of dough on the prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 9 minutes. Do not over bake these cookies, they will look puffy and slightly underdone, but they will finish cooking on the baking sheet after coming out of the oven. Let them sit on the baking sheet 3-4 minutes once out of the oven. Transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
Cream Cheese Icing: Start with the icing by placing the butter and cream cheese in a medium sized mixing bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy.

Spray a mini muffin pan liberally with cooking spray. Using a hand mixer, cream butter, peanut butter and white and brown sugars. Mix in egg and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Add in flour, baking soda and salt, stirring until combined.
Measure out dough into 1 TBSP scoops. {I use my 1 TBSP cookie scoop so this process is super fast!} No need to shape the cookies, just place each scoop in one compartment of a mini muffin tin. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until lightly browned.
Remove from oven and immediately make wells in the center of each using a melon baller or a 1 tsp measuring spoon. Make a good sized well in the center so that you can add a lot of fudge! Cool in pan for 8-10 minutes. Then carefully remove to wire racks. I used coconut oil in my recipe, so the cookies popped out super easily. If you use butter, you should spray the muffin pans well, as instructed earlier, so that your cookies come out easy too! Cool for an additional 10-15 minutes.
While the cookies are cooling, you can prepare the fudge filling. Combine the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in a microwave safe bowl. Mix lightly and microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. The mixture doesn’t look melted, but give it a few gentle stirs and you’ll see it’s heated well enough. Add vanilla and stir again until smooth.
Transfer about half the fudge into a quart-sized ziplock bag. Squeeze the fudge into a corner and snip the corner off. Now you can easily pipe the fudge into the cookies! The great thing about this fudge too is that it sets up super fast, so feel free to fill the cookies well, so that the fudge goes above the cookie- it will set up and not run out! If your fudge gets too solid, just pop it back in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.

In the bowl of a stand mixer that was fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a mixing bowl with a hand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar, on medium speed until light and fluffy. This usually takes about 3 to 5 minutes. Then, add in the egg and vanilla extract and mix again until combined.
Using a rubber spatula, fold in the dry flour mixture into the butter mixture and stir to incorporate. The dough will look dry at first, but as you mix, it will hydrate and look more uniform. Proceed to spread the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and press it out into a flat disc. Wrap it in the plastic wrap until well covered.
Chill: Then place the dough into the fridge and let it chill for 1-2 hours or until firm.
Prep: When you are ready to bake the cookies, prepare two baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper and then set them aside. Start to preheat the oven to 350degrees F.
Shape: Roll out the dough onto a floured surface until it is 1/8 of an inch thick. Use a 2.75-inch round cookie cutter to cut out the cookie shapes. After that, use a small heart-shaped cookie cutter or another small cookie cutter shape, to cut holes out of the center of half of the cookies. Each cookie will have a top and bottom, the top cookie will have the center cut out.
Continue to gently transfer the cookies to the baking sheets and keep them spaced at least 1 inch apart from each other. Reroll and cookie dough scraps and cut more cookies, making sure to get half of the cookies to have their centers removed, as before. If the dough is too warm to handle, place it into the fridge to firm up again.
Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are just beginning to brown and the middle of the cookies look set and no longer shiny. These cookies are thin so they can burn quickly, be sure to watch them closely.
Assemble: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes or until they are firm enough to be transported to a wire rack to continue cooling. Then, place all of the cookies with their center holes removed onto a baking sheet or another easily cleanable surface.
Dust the tops of these cookies with powdered sugar by running it through a fine-mesh sieve. Spread about ½ a teaspoon of jam onto the bottom side of the cookies that do not have holes cut from them.

Add in and beat the egg, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest until fully combined.
Add in the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined, the dough will be very crumbly.
Portion and Roll: Portion out the dough into 6 equal-sized pieces, these will be jumbo cookie size. Form each portion into a ball by pressing the dough just until it comes together to form a ball. Place the dough onto a baking sheet and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F while the dough balls are chilling.
Once the dough has chilled, place it in the oven and bake the cookies for 15-18 minutes. The edges should look golden brown when finished. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely.
Prepare the Frosting: Whip the butter in a large mixing bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, until fluffy.
Add in the powdered sugar (one cup at a time) and beat to combine. Add up to 5 cups until you’ve reached the desired frosting consistency. Add in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the vanilla extract, continue to mix until combined.
Divide the buttercream into 3 or 4 bowls and add food coloring to each one. Blend until you have achieved the colors you want.
Assemble frosting bag: Unroll a large 18-inch piece of plastic wrap. Spread each color of frosting in a line down the plastic wrap leaving a 3-4-inch space on each end. You should have about 3 or 4 lines of frosting, and it’s okay if they touch, just don’t place them on top of each other.
Grasp the top and bottom of the plastic wrap (where the blank spaces are) and roll the plastic closed. The frosting will now be rolled together and look like a log. Twist both ends of the plastic wrap together to create a tootsie-roll-like package of frosting.
Insert the rolled frosting into a frosting piping bag. Pull it all the way down so that one end of the frosting meets the bottom of the bag where the frosting tip is. The other end will extend out of the bag from the wider end.
Decorate: Snip the plastic wrap off where it meets the frosting tip. Press the frosting down into the tip and pipe the frosting onto your cookies. Top each cookie with some Easter-colored sprinkles.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with non-stick cooking spray.
Start by softening your butter in a microwave safe bowl in the microwave, this typically takes 15-20 seconds.
Then, move the butter to a large mixing bowl and whip it with a whisk for about 5 minutes. You can also use a Kitchen Aid mixer or a handheld electric mixer for this step too. The butter is whipped adequately when it looks more like whipped cream.
Next, lay about 20-25 maraschino cherries out on a napkin to dry. I gently pressed another napkin on top to absorb additional moisture.
After the butter is whipped well, add the sugar, almond extract, cornstarch and the flour and whisk well to combine. Continue to mix on high for 3-4 additional minutes.
If you have a 1 TBSP cookie scoop, using it makes this process very easy. Shortbread dough is very soft and buttery, so it is actually pretty difficult to shape by itself.
Using your cookie scoop, scoop out the dough and level it off using the side of the bowl.
Then, stick your thumb into the center of the scoop of leveled dough.
After that, put a cherry inside the thumbprint and gently press down.
Using the dough that has collected on the sides, cover the top of the cherry.
Push the lever to eject the cookie out of the scoop and into your hand, round out the cookie dough into balls.
Place each ball of dough onto your prepared baking sheet about 1-2"" apart.
Repeat process until all cookie dough is used.
Put the cookies in the preheated oven and bake for 12-14 minutes, until the bottom of the cookies begin to lightly brown.
Once baking is complete, remove from the oven and let them sit for a few minutes to cool down on the pan. Shortbread cookies are soft and fragile even after baking, so if you try to move them too soon, they might crack or fall apart.
In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, melted butter, and the maraschino cherry juice.
Then, put a plastic baggie over the top of a cup and scrape the icing into the baggie.
Proceed to cut a small piece off the corner from the baggie and drizzle over the top of each cookie.
If you do not want to add the cherry surprise center that is ok too! Follow all the same instructions until you get to the cherry center and jump to the instructions below.
Once the cookie dough is completely mixed, drop the cookie dough onto a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper.
Using the plastic wrap, gently form the dough into a cookie log if you will. The dough will shape easily- I like mine at about a 1.5″ thick.
Then, place the cookie log into the freezer for 5-10 minutes. You do not want it frozen solid, you just want it cold enough so that you can slice.
After it is chilled, unwrap the cookie log and use a sharp, thin knife to slice the dough into rounds.

Shape: Then, spray cooking spray onto the backside of a teaspoon measuring spoon and immediately press it down into the center of each cookie cup to create a well in the center of each. This is creating the cookie cup that you are going to fill with yummy creamy filling.
You want to allow the cookies to cool completely before adding the filling, give it 20-30 minutes or so. If you are in a rush you can pop the tray of cookie cups into the freezer for about15-20 minutes.

Heat a small pot of simmering water over medium-low heat. Add the egg whites and granulated sugar to a heatproof bowl and set it over the simmering water. Whisk constantly until the sugar has fully dissolved– about 2 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment– be careful not to get any water in the bowl!
Beat on medium-high speed (Kitchenaid #8) until stiff peaks form– about 5-7 minutes.
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the powdered sugar and almond flour into the egg white mixture.
Gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites by making a J shape with your spatula.
Once all of the dry ingredients have been incorporated, continue to fold the meringue but this time gently smush the batter against the sides of the bowl before folding it back together.Continue to smush and fold the meringue a few times before testing to see if it has reached the Figure 8 stage. The meringue is ready to pipe when you can draw a figure 8 without the stream breaking.
Transfer the meringue to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip (Wilton #10-12). Pipe 1” macaron shells onto the tray, making sure to pipe them at least 2” apart.
Once you’ve finished piping the first tray, hold it about 6 inches off the counter and drop it straight down. Drop the tray another 5-6 times, or until it looks like any large air bubbles have popped. Repeat with the second tray.
Set the trays aside to rest for 25 minutes, or until they have developed a skin. They’re ready to bake when you can touch them gently without the meringue sticking to your finger.
While the macarons rest, preheat your oven to 325F.
Bake the macarons, one tray at a time, for 13 minutes. If your oven has hot spots, make sure to turn the tray halfway through baking so the feet rise evenly.
Allow the macarons to cool to room temperature on the pan. Trying to remove the macarons while still warm may result in sticking.
In a medium-sized heat proof bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, cornstarch, and egg yolk until it is pale yellow in color– about 1 minute.
Add the milk and vanilla bean paste to a small saucepan set over medium heat. Bring it just to a simmer (it should just be starting to bubble around the edges).
Slowly pour the milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Make sure to pour slowly and don’t stop whisking– you don’t want scrambled eggs!
Once all of the milk has been added, pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture starts to thicken.
Once the custard can coat the back of a spoon, remove it from the heat and whisk in the butter.
Transfer it to an airtight container and cover the top with plastic wrap (make sure it’s touching the custard so it doesn’t form a skin).
Place the custard in the fridge to cool completely before transferring it to a piping bag.
Add the cream and chocolate to a heatproof bowl and microwave for 1-2 minutes, whisking every 30 seconds.
Dip the top of half of the macaron shells into the ganache and allow them to set fully before continuing– placing them in the fridge can help speed up this process.
Pipe a small dollop of pastry cream onto the flat side of a macaron that has not been dipped in chocolate. Place a chocolate dipped macaron shell on top and press down gently, just until the filling reaches the edges.
Repeat with the remaining macarons. Transfer the filling macarons to an airtight container and store them in the fridge overnight to soften.

Roll the dough into about ½-inch balls or about 1 tablespoon worth of dough, and line them on the sheet. You don’t need much room between them, so about half an inch should do the trick.

Add the powdered sugar and almond flour to a fine mesh sieve. Sift them together into the egg whites. Discard any large lumps– don’t force them through the sieve.
Gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites by making a J shape with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites at this point.
Once the dry ingredients have been fully incorporated, smush the batter against the sides of the bowl and fold it back together. Repeat this process a few times before checking if the meringue is at the Figure 8 stage.
If you can draw a figure 8 with the meringue without the stream breaking, it’s ready to pipe. If the batter breaks or falls off in clumps, smush and fold a few more times before retesting the figure 8.
When the meringue flows smoothly, transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a round tip (I like a Wilton #10). Pipe 1.5” circles on the sheet pan.

With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture. The cookie dough will be very stiff.

For the filling, in a medium bowl (or in your stand mixer) beat the cream cheese and marshmallow fluff until smooth.
Add in the melted white chocolate and peppermint extract, continue blending.
Mix in the crushed peppermint candy and blend. The candy will melt and you will have a lovely pink tinted filling. You can deepen the color if you want with a small amount of red food coloring.
For ease of filling the cookies, place filling in a large piping bag OR a gallon size plastic bag with a zipper top and a small corner cut off.
Turn half the cookies upside down so that the flat bottom is facing up. Pipe a generous amount of filling onto these cookies.

Make the peanut butter filling. Stir together the peanut butter and powdered sugar until smooth. Use a small cookie scoop to scoop out the filling onto a plate or cookie sheet lined with wax paper. You should be able to make about 20-22 balls. Place in freezer for about 30 minutes.
While the peanut butter balls are freezing, you can make the cookie dough. Cream the butter and sugars together with an electric mixer for about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and continue to mix for 1-2 more minutes. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt and continue to mix until smooth.
Scoop out a heaping tablespoonful of cookie dough (I used a medium cookie scoop or you can just overfill a small one) and flatten it out between your hands like a pancake. Place a frozen peanut butter ball on top and then fold up the edges of the cookie until the peanut butter ball is completely covered. If it doesn't look like a ball at this point, roll it between your palms to form a ball. (Unless you have a couple of people making these, you'll want to keep at least half of the peanut butter balls in the freezer when you first begin, and then work quickly so that the peanut butter doesn't start thawing as you are assembling the cookies- the process gets a lot messier once it starts to thaw out!)
Place some sugar in a shallow bowl and gently roll the cookie ball in the sugar until coated on all sides. The sugar will help prevent the balls from sticking to the cookie sheets, makes the cookies prettier, and adds a nice little texture to the cookies as well!
Place the cookie balls at least 2"" apart on a prepared cookie sheet. You can use well-greased cookie sheets or you can use cookie sheets lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. I prefer the silicone baking mats because nothing sticks to them!
Bake for about 10-12 minutes. I usually stick to the lower end of baking times on cookies because I like them really soft, but if you like them a little bit firmer and well-done, you can bake them a minute or two longer.

Making Coconut Macadamia Nut Cookies

Despite the fancy sounding ingredients in this cookie, it actually isn’t much different than your traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes. You just toss in chopped nuts and coconut, well of course, then there’s the bread flour thing. This cookie recipe can be done with regular flour or bread flour- use what you have on hand!

What’s the Difference Between Regular Flour and Bread Flour?

Protein. Regular flour has a lower level of protein, enough so that when you use bread flour for recipes you instantly get a higher rise, nicer chew and whatever you use it for gets a lot of gluten goodness inside. This is why bread flour is preferred for foods like bagels and pretzels, but all purpose flour can be used as is or with some added vital wheat gluten to increase the protein content.

How Do You Cut Macadamia Nuts for Cookies?

Lay your nuts out on a cutting board and with a sharp chef knife in one hand, slice through them giving you different sized chunks of nuts for your cookies. You want there to be some larger pieces as that’s what helps to make the cookie awesome.

Coconut Macadamia Nut Cookies Ingredients

Here’s what you’ll need:

-butter: I use real salted butter!

-all purpose flour: you can also use bread flour if you’d like

-salt & baking soda

-granulated sugar & brown sugar

-1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk

-milk

-vanilla extract

-semi sweet chocolate chips

-1 cup shredded coconut (toasted or plain)

-1/2 cup macadamia nuts, loosely chopped (you want nice, big chunks)

How to Make Coconut Macadamia Nut Cookie

Preheat your oven to 375F degrees.

In a large mixing bowl cream together the butter and sugars until creamy and smooth while using an electric mixer.

Add in the eggs, vanilla, and milk. Continue to mix to combine while slowly adding in the flour, salt, and baking soda until everything is well combined.

On low speed, stir in the chocolate chips, coconut, and nuts.

Using a 2″ cookie scoop, spoon the dough out and onto a parchment lined cookie sheet. You can fit 6 cookies per sheet. Stick the tray in the freezer for 10 minutes.

After the dough has been chilled, bake the cookies for about 15 minutes, checking the cookies after 10 minutes, and then rotating the tray to ensure even browning.

If you opt to make the 1″ cookies, chill about 5 minutes and then bake for about 10 minutes.

2 tbsp milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
1 cup shredded coconut (toasted or plain)
1/2 cup macadamia nuts, loosely chopped (you want nice, big chunks)
Instructions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, blend the sugars and butter until creamy and smooth.
Add in eggs, vanilla, and milk; mix to combine on medium speed until smooth. Slowly add in flour, salt and baking soda; mix until well combined.
On low speed, stir in chocolate chips, coconut, and nuts.

Notes
Because of the amount of butter in them, these cookies turn out a tad bit darker than most other cookies. It's okay. Mrs. Fields' turned out the same way. I promise you didn't over bake them.

Can You Freeze Coconut Nut Cookies?

Yes, you could freeze these cookies if you wanted to extend their shelf life. To freeze them I recommend letting them cool completely before individually wrapping in plastic wrap and then storing in an airtight container. This way when you want to eat one all you have to do is grab one from the container and place it on the counter for about 30 minutes to thaw. They can last up to 3 months in the freezer.

Should I use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut?

That choice is completely up to you. A sweeter coconut will definitely help to give a little extra sweetness to this cookie but unsweetened could be a great balance between the natural sweetness already in this cookie recipe. Pick and choose the one you think will be best or try the recipe twice with both so you can know for sure!

Next, add a swirl of yellow chocolate to the top of the peppermint patty. Then add a pinch of green coconut to the top of that.
Now, grab the other [20] wafer cookies and lay those out flat side up and add a swirl of red chocolate to those cookies. Proceed to place these cookies (ketchup side down) on top of the lettuce and gently squeeze the hamburger together so the cookie stays together.

You need the zest from one lime for the dough, use the fine side of the grater, set the zest aside. For the filling, you need the juice from one lime. Squeeze the lime you just zested into a small bowl, set this aside as well.
You need ½ cup of lime juice for the frosting, juice 1-2 limes, depending on their size, until you've procured the required amount of juice.
Cookie dough: In a large bowl, cream the butter and both sugars, with an electric mixer, until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and lime zest and mix until combined.
Add in the flour, baking powder, and salt, mixing until just combined. The dough will be very crumbly.
Divide the dough into 6 equal-sized portions (or 12 portions for smaller cookies). Flatten the balls slightly, place them onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and press an indent into the center of each dough ball (I use my large cookie scoop for this).
Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.
Prep filling: Prepare the lime filling so that it has a chance to rest in the fridge before use. In a small bowl, whip together the condensed milk and lime juice with an electric mixer or whisk, and then cover the bowl. Place into the fridge to chill until needed.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Pull the cookies from the fridge and place in the preheated oven to bake for 15-18 minutes. The edges should be just barely golden brown. For smaller cookies, bake for 9-12 minutes depending on the size of the cookies. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
Buttercream frosting: Mix the butter with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add in the powdered sugar and beat again to combine. Add in the lime juice and mix.
Transfer the frosting into a piping bag or a ziplocked baggie with the corner snipped off. Pipe the frosting around the edges of each cookie and then spoon some of the lime filling into the middle of each frosting circle.

Cream butter, shortening and sugar until smooth. Add in egg and vanilla and mix again. Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl; whisk to incorporate.
Add dry ingredients to butter mixture and mix to combine. Scoop out 1.5 TBSP balls. Place on parchment lined baking sheet. Using the bottom of a glass that's been sprayed with non-stick spray, gently flatten each cookie dough ball until each is about 1/4"" thick.
Bake cookies 10-12 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring over to a cooling rack.
To make the chocolate glaze: Heat butter and whipping cream in a glass bowl in the microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds. Add in chocolate chips and cover bowl with a small plate. Let sit 5 minutes, then whisk mixture until the ingredients combine and the chocolate is smooth & shiny. Transfer 3-4 TBSP chocolate glaze into a small sandwich baggie. Cut the corner when ready to pipe.
To make the vanilla glaze: Melt butter. Add in vanilla, powdered sugar and enough milk to make the glaze smooth and spreadable. Transfer 3-4 TBSP vanilla glaze into a small sandwich baggie. Cut the corner when ready to pipe.
To make cobweb design: Spoon about 1 TBSP glaze onto a cookie. Pipe the opposite glaze onto the top, making circles in varying sizes. Begin in the middle, making a small circle, then make 2-3 more circles, increasing in size but taking care to not touch the lines of each circle. Take a toothpick and begin in the middle, dragging the toothpick through the lines of each circle. Make several identical lines all around the cookie. Icing will cool and set within minutes. Spiderweb design is easy to do when the icing is NOT SET, so don't try to do several cookies at the same time. I found you can really do 2 or 3 at once, max. I spooned vanilla icing on 3, then piped on the chocolate icing in circles and made the toothpick lines on each. Then I moved on to the next cookies, this time spooning on chocolate icing and piping vanilla lines. Continue until all cookies are glazed.

Then, pour the cornflakes in a ziplocked bag and crush them with a rolling pin or cylinder shaped item. Transfer them to a medium size bowl and then add in the milk powder, sugar, and salt, stir to mix. Next, add the melted butter and toss to combine. As you toss, the butter will act as glue, binding the dry ingredients to the cereal and creating small clusters. After that, spread the clusters on a parchment lined sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes, at which point they should look toasted, smell buttery, and crunch gently when cooled slightly and chewy.
Cookie dough: Combine the butter and both types of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the egg and vanilla extract and beat for 7 to 8 minutes. You can accomplish this using an electric handheld mixer as well. Then, reduce the mixer speed to low and add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together (no longer than 1 minute).
Next, on low speed, add in the cornflake crunch and mini chocolate chips until they are incorporated. After that, divide the cookie dough into 1/4 cup balls, stuff 2 mini marshmallows in the center of the dough and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour, or place in freezer for 30-45 minutes. (This step is critical, they must be chilled!)
Bake: Start preheating the oven to 365° F. Re-arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on the parchment paper and bake for 11-16 minutes(check the cookies at 11 minutes). The cookies will puff, crackle, and spread.

Scoop dough out using a 2 TBSP cookie scoop and put one in each mini muffin cup. No need to roll the dough to make it smooth- it will all bake the same.
Bake for 15-18 minutes, making sure they’re not getting too brown at the end. If they are, pull them out.
Right after you take them out, use a small measuring spoon to push into the middle of each cookie, creating a space for the fudge filling to go. You don’t want to push through the cookie completely- but make sure you create a big enough space.
Let them cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then gently run a thin knife along the sides to pop them out. If you greased the pan well, you shouldn’t have any problems here.
To make the fudge filling: Combine the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in a microwave safe bowl. Mix lightly and microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. The mixture doesn’t look melted, but give it a few gentle stirs and you’ll see it’s heated well enough. Add vanilla extract and stir again until smooth.
Transfer about ¾ the fudge into a quart-sized ziplocked bag. Squeeze the fudge into a corner and snip the corner off. Now you can easily pipe the fudge into the cookies. If your fudge gets too solid, just pop it back in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.
To assemble the cookies: Cut the rounded part off the candy canes and adhere them to the side of each cookie cup with melted white chocolate. This is actually real easy- just put white chocolate on the cut portion of the candy cane, press it to the side of the cookie cup, then set it down on the counter until white chocolate is solid.

Whisk royal icing ingredients together until smooth. Separate roughly 3 TBSP worth of icing each into 2 small bowls. Add a few drops of red coloring to one of the bowls and blue to the other. Stir until color is even. Transfer blue and red icing to separate baggies.
Pour white icing onto the cookie bars and quickly spread over the entire surface, until smooth and even. Cut the corners of each of the baggies holding red and blue icing.
