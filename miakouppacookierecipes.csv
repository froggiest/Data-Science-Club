Chocolate crinkle cookies,miakouppa,5, 1 ,Dessert,American,Prep Time: 20 minutes minutes,Cook Time: 15 minutes minutes,Resting time: 2 hours hours,Total Time: 2 hours hours 35 minutes minutes,26 cookies,12,"In a double boiler, melt the chopped dark chocolate.  Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave.  Let cool while you prepare the next steps.
Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, beat together the oil and the brown sugar and granulated sugar on medium speed for about 2 minutes. It will look crystallized.
Add the eggs, and vanilla. Mix on medium-low until combined.
Next add in the melted dark chocolate and mix on low speed until fully combined.
With the mixer still on low speed slowly add in the flour mixture.  Beat until just well combined.  The cookie dough will be slightly sticky.
Place the cookie dough in a clean bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  This will help prevent the cookies from expanding and spreading out too much while baking.  This is a very important step, don't skip it. At this point, the dough can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 6 weeks.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  While your oven is preheating, let your dough sit out at room temperature for 5-10 minutes.  
Put your icing sugar in a small bowl.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. For each cookie, take a heaping tablespoon of dough (a small ice-cream scoop works great) and form a ball using the palm of your hands. Roll each ball in the icing sugar until completely and thoroughly covered.  Shake a bit, and roll again in the icing sugar. Place the balls 3 inches apart on the baking pan. 
Bake the cookies for approximately 12 minutes.  Do not over bake them.  You want the inside to be like a brownie.  Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.  They will be soft but will harden up as they cool down.

In the bowl of your stand mixer, beat together the butter and sugars for about 3 minutes.  Add in the eggs, extracts and continue to beat for another 5 minutes at medium speed.
With the mixer speed set to low, add in the dry ingredients.  Mix until just combined.
Transfer your dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap and knead it until it forms a ball.  Flatten your ball to a disc that is about 1 inch thick. Cover the dough entirely with plastic wrap and then place in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
Preheat oven to 350 °F
Roll out your dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or on a lightly floured surface until it is ¼ inch thick.  This is easier to do if you portion out your dough so that you are only dealing with a little at a time.  Use your cookie cutters to create shapes and transfer the cookies to a parchment lined cookie sheet.
Bake in the middle rack of your oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges are firm.   You will notice that the centers of the cookies still appear soft; this is normal.
Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

"Melomakarona, Greek Christmas Honey Cookies",Billie Bitzas,4.90, 49 ,Dessert,Greek,Prep Time: 2 hours hours 15 minutes minutes,Cook Time: 15 minutes minutes,Cooling time (minimum): 2 hours hours,NA,90 cookies,14,"Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, placing your rack in the middle.
In a large bowl combine the orange rind,  orange juice, vegetable oil, honey, cognac, sugar, crushed walnuts, ground cloves, and ground cinnamon.
In a smaller bowl mix together 3 cups of your sifted flour with the baking powder and baking soda. Mix well with a fork or wire whisk to combine.  Add this flour mixture to the large bowl containing the previous ingredients.
With your hands, mix everything together. Once everything is mixed well add the remaining flour, one cup at a time, mixing after each addition.  You will end up with a dough which is somewhat greasy, not stiff, and with which you are able to form a ball that will keep its shape.  You may need to add more sifted flour, in order to get your cookie dough to resemble the consistency pictured.  If you do add more flour, add 1/4 cup at a time.  Be sure to knead the dough very well, and for several minutes.  This will ensure that all of the oil is incorporated into the flour.
Taking one tablespoon of dough at a time  (use 30-35 grams, per cookie) form oval shaped cookies which you will flatten slightly so that they are approximately 1 centimeter thick.  When shaping your cookies, knead the dough in your hand, make a ball, and then turn that ball into an oval shaped cookie which is about 2 1/2 inches long.  Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a one inch space between cookies. 
Flatten slightly with the flats of your fingers. Using a fork, make a few indentations on top of each cookie.
Bake in middle rack of oven for 10 – 15 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
Remove from oven, let rest on baking sheet for about 1 – 2 minutes and then place cookies on cooling rack.
Meanwhile, combine  the crushed walnuts with the sesame seeds and mix well. Keep aside.
Once your cookies are fully cooled, (we actually like to let them cool overnight) prepare your syrup. Heat your honey in a small saucepan.  Once the honey has liquefied (which will happen when the honey is brought to a boil) carefully add 2 tablespoons of boiling water. Skim off any foam which may develop on surface of honey.  Reduce heat to a very low simmer.
Prepare a sheet of parchment paper near the stovetop.  This is where you will place your honey dipped cookies.  Sprinkle some of the walnut-sesame seed mixture onto the paper (this will keep the bottoms of the cookie from sticking to the parchment).
Place as many cookies as will fit into the saucepan containing the honey.  Let them soak for about 30 – 45 seconds.  Depending upon the size of your saucepan, you may need to occasionally push down on them gently with a spoon if they are floating in the honey, in order to soak the entire cookie. Alternatively, you can use a spoon to carefully drizzle some honey on top of the cookies. You can also carefully flip them over. Remove from honey with a slotted spoon, place on parchment paper and while still hot sprinkle some of the walnut-sesame seed mixture over the top.
Let cool.  You can now place individual cookies in cupcake liners.  This makes them easier to pick up and eat without getting your fingers too sticky.

Beat at medium speed for 2 – 3 minutes. Next add the eggs and beat at medium speed for 5 minutes. 
Sift 5 ¾ cups of flour and add in the baking powder.  Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just well combined. You may need to add in more sifted flour. The dough mixture should come away from the edges of your bowl (see this video). If it does not, you will need to add more sifted flour, a bit at a time.  We use a total of 6 cups + 1 tbsp of sifted flour. Your dough should be sticky, but you should still be able to form it into a ball. See video here.
Allow your dough to rest for at least 20-30 minutes at room temperature.  The longer you let the dough sit, the more manageable it will be.
Preheat your oven to 375 °F
Shape your cookies into ""S"" forms.  See video here. If you like, you can spread out some sesame seeds on the surface on which you are rolling the cookies, and roll some sesame seeds onto the cookies, as you are shaping them.  The video above helps explain this step.  
To make each cookie uniform we measure out the dough and have found that the best weight per koulouraki is between 28-30 grams and 5 inches long, before we shape it.  Place your koulourakia on a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake in the middle rack of your oven for approximately 18 minutes.  At the 15 minute mark, rotate your pan, and bake for another 3-4 minutes, until tops are golden, and bottoms are golden brown.

Crush the cardamom pods with the back of a knife.  Combine all the ingredients for the syrup into a small pot and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Stir and cook until sugar dissolves, and then for an additional 5 minutes over medium heat.  Remove the pot from the heat and allow to cool in the pot.  Leave the orange peel, cinnamon stick and cardamom pods in the syrup as it cools.
In the bowl of your stand mixer combine the water, sugar and yeast.  Whisk together until combined and allow to sit at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes.  You should see the surface of your mixture puff up and bubble slightly.   
Meanwhile, combine the dry ingredients together and whisk to combine. Set aside.
Once your yeast has proofed, add the orange zest and the liquid ingredients to the bowl.  Mix to combine using the dough hook attachment of your mixer.  Next, add the dry ingredients and knead the dough for a few minutes until a soft ball is formed and it pulls from the side of the bowl.
Measure your dough if you have a kitchen scale and separate it into 1/3 and 2/3 portions; my dough usually totals around 990 grams, so I reserve about 330 grams to make the chocolate dough.  Transfer the larger portion of dough to a bowl, cover, and set aside to rise until doubled in size, or about 2 hours.
Return the smaller portion of dough to the bowl of the stand mixer. Sift the cocoa powder and cinnamon over the dough.  Use a food processor or a blender to finely chop the walnuts.  Add the finely crushed walnuts and the orange juice to the bowl.  Knead with the dough hook attachment on medium speed until everything is well combined.  if your dough appears too dry, add some additional olive oil.  Set the dough aside, covered, to rise until doubled in size, or about 2 hours.
Once your dough has risen separate both the vanilla and the chocolate dough into two halves.  On a lightly floured surface roll one half of the chocolate dough into a log, about an inch thick and about 12 inches long – set aside.  Then, on the same lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out half the vanilla dough into a rectangle – about 12 inches long and 8 inches high; the dough will be thin.  
Place the chocolate dough along one of the long edges of the vanilla dough and  roll the dough tightly so that the vanilla dough wraps around the chocolate dough.  Using a sharp knife, slice the log into approximately 15 pieces, each about 1 inch thick; I use my thumb as a guide. Do not worry if you squish the dough as you are slicing through it.  Repeat the entire process with the second half of the vanilla and chocolate dough.
Once all your slices are made, use your hands to shape the pastries into rounds and to flatten them until they are about 1/2 inch thick.  Transfer them to a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake in the middle rack of your oven for between 22 – 25 minutes; you will likely need to do this in batches.
Once all of your roxakia are baked, transfer them all to the same baking sheet or other container and pour the cooled syrup over them.

When just combined (that is, you no longer see any flour), add in the chocolate covered almonds and mix briefly until well combined.
Line your baking tray with parchment paper. Half your dough and roll to make two logs which are approximately 1 inch think and 4 inches wide.  We find it helpful to grease our hands with olive oil before shaping.  Place on a parchment lined baking tray.  Flatten a little bit using your hands. Optional: If you wish to decorate the top of your biscotti with slivered almonds, brush the top of the dough with a thin layer of egg white and then sprinkle the slivered almonds on top.

Begin adding your flour to the butter, sugar and egg mixture.  Add half the flour, mix well and then add the rest of the flour; mix well until just combined. Be careful not to over mix.  The dough will be a little dense, and slightly crumbly. This is okay! Transfer the dough to another mixing bowl and mix with your hands until the dough holds together.

In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy, approximately 5 minutes.
To the butter and sugar mixture add the egg, peanut butter and vanilla extract.  Beat for an additional 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a separate bowl whisk together the dry ingredients. 
Add the dry ingredients to the mixer bowl and beat until the ingredients are just combined.
Line your baking sheet with parchment paper and use a mini ice cream scooper to make your cookies.  Alternatively, use a tablespoon and make round balls of dough.  After you have arranged the balls of dough on your cookie sheet, use a fork to gently press down on the dough.  This will flatten the cookie, and leave the impression from the fork tines.  Your cookies should be approximately ½ inch thick. 
Bake in the middle rack of your oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until the bottom of your cookies is browned.
Allow to cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transferring carefully to a cooling rack.

In the bowl of your stand mixer combine the sugar and oil and beat for about 5 minutes at medium speed.
Next add the milk and the eggs, one at a time.  Beat for another 5 minutes. Next add your mixed nuts and mix until just combined. 
In a small bowl combine the baking powder and cinnamon with a ¼ cup of your already measured sifted flour. Whisk to combine and then add to the bowl of your mixer.  
With the mixer speed set to low, begin adding the rest of the flour, about a ½ cup at a time.  You may not need all of the flour. You will know that you have added enough flour when the dough starts pulling away from the sides of the mixing bowl.  At this time, you will likely have to transfer the dough to a larger mixing bowl, to finish kneading by hand.
Add 1 teaspoon of oil to bottom of a large bowl.. Add your dough and keep kneading.  The dough should feel a little dense and tough, to prevent it from spreading too much while baking.  At the same time it should feel soft and it will be sticky. See video here.
Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes so it can firm up.
Separate out your dough into 425 grams portions. Dust your counter with a bit of flour and form the dough into logs which are  2-2 ¾ inches wide, and place on a parchment lined baking tray. The length of the log should be the width of the baking pan.  Flatten a little bit using your hands.  See video here.
Lightly score the dough horizontally about 1/3 of the way deep and about 3/4-1 inch apart. See video here.
Bake in middle rack of your oven for 25-30 minutes.  Rotate your pan halfway through the baking time.
Remove from oven, and while still hot, and still in pan, cut your dough (where it had been scored) all the way through.  Flip each piece  on its side.  Broil for 1-2 minutes per side; watch them carefully so that they don' t burn. See video here.

Place the chopped up almonds in a sieve and shake it over a large bowl. Catch the small almond bits in the bowl and then place the larger pieces of almonds in a frying pan and toast them over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. You will know that they are toasted when you can smell the toasted almonds. Remove the almonds from the heat, and transfer them immediately to the bowl with the small almond pieces to cool.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle, beat together the melted vegetable shortening, olive oil, melted butter and icing sugar.  Mix well until combined and there are no lumps of sugar visible, about 2-3 minutes.   
Add the egg yolks and ouzo to the bowl of your stand mixer and mix for about 4-5 minutes.
With the speed of the mixer set to low, slowly incorporate the flour / baking soda / vanilla mixture (See Recipe Note).  Mix until just well combined.  Use a rubber spatula to clean the edges of your bowl and to make sure that all ingredients get incorporated.  Add the almonds to the cookie dough and mix until evenly distributed.
At this point I refrigerate the dough for 2-3 hours, before shaping. This will prevent the kourambiethes from spreading too much while baking.  Once you're ready to shape your kourabiedes, leave the dough at room temperature for about 10 minutes.
Preheat your oven to 350 °F, and place your rack in the middle of your oven.
Line your cookie sheets with parchment paper.  Begin shaping your kourabiethes. Keep in mind, that the dough is a little oily. If you will be shaping them as crescents, use one tablespoon of dough, per crescent.  SEE NOTES BELOW.  Remember, the cookies will puff up during cooking, so your crescents should be relatively thin (about an inch in diameter). I found that the best way to shape them is by rolling the dough in my hands,  ending up with a 3 inch long piece of dough, (about the width of your palm) and creating the crescent in the baking pan. If you are going to be shaping them in rounds, using a mini ice-cream scooper is a great option.  Roll the dough in your hands until you get a smooth round shape, which you can flatten slightly when in the baking tray.  Leave about 2 inches between each cookie.  
You'll notice that the dough is crumbly, almost like a pebble texture; place the amount of dough you'll be using in your hands, and just squeeze the dough together back and forth between your hands and you'll see that it will stick together. 
Once you have filled up a baking tray, place in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking.  After 10 minutes, remove from the fridge, and place immediately into your preheated oven. right into the oven.  This is a very important step.. It helps further reduce the amount the kourambiethes spread while baking.
Bake in the middle rack of your oven for approximately 12-14 minutes.  However, check them after 11 minutes.  Some ovens bake quicker than others. Remove the cookies from the oven and using a pastry brush, sprinkle some rose water on the cookies.  You can also use ouzo if you prefer.  Allow the cookies to cool on the baking tray for about two minutes and then transfer them carefully to a cooling rack.
When your cookies are completely cool, line a serving tray or container with icing sugar and set your cookies on it. Then, liberally sift icing sugar over the cookies so that they are completely covered.

The best way to cut your blondies it to use a serrated knife and to wipe it clean after each cut.
Blondies will keep for several days at room temperature in a tightly covered container.  Otherwise, store in the refrigerator.  They can also be frozen!

Set aside.
In the bowl of your stand mixer (or using your hand held mixer) beat the butter until nice and fluffy.  Add the sugar and continue to mix until well combined.
Next, add the egg and the vanilla.  Beat well at medium speed until the dough pulls off the side of the bowl and all the ingredients are incorporated together.
Remove half of the dough and form it into a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside.  
To the dough remaining in the bowl add the food colouring.  Beat well until the food colouring is incorporated and the dough is uniform in colour.  We suggest beginning with 1/4 teaspoon of food colouring gel and increasing from there until you get the colour that you want.
Form this coloured dough into a ball and wrap it as well with plastic wrap.  Chill both balls of dough in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes. 
When you are ready to shape and bake your cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Prepare a baking tray with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Remove dough from fridge and cut off pieces of both the white and coloured dough.  Press them together to make a ball.  
Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/3 inch.  We find that rolling the dough between two pieces of either wax paper or parchment paper makes it much easier. 
Use your cookie cutter to cut out your heart shapes.  Place your cookie cutter strategically to give you pretty colour patterns.
Transfer the cookies to the baking tray.  When your tray is full, bake in the middle rack of your oven for between 10 - 12 minutes. 
Remove tray from oven and allow the cookies to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooking rack.

Christmas koulourakia with yeast (Χριστουγεννιάτικα κουλουράκια με μαγιά),Mia Kouppa,5, 1 ,"Bread, meze, Snack",Greek,Prep Time: 30 minutes minutes,Cook Time: 20 minutes minutes,"Resting time, total: 14 hours hours",Total Time: 14 hours hours 50 minutes minutes,85 cookies,8,"The night before you are planning to make your koulourakia, mix your flour with the olive oil and the vegetable oil.   The flour will be somewhat crumbly; cover it with a clean kitchen towel and leave at room temperature until you are ready to use it the next day.
Several hours before you are planning to make your koulourakia you must prepare the liquid which will be used for the dough.
In a medium size pot combine the orange peel, cinnamon stick, nutmeg, cloves, thyme and salt.  Add 1 liter and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to medium high and cook, covered, for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow to rest with the cover still on for approximately 2 hours, or longer. If you prepare the liquid the night before, you can keep it in the refrigerator after it has come to room temperature. You will have to reheat it to warm for the next step.
In a small mixing bowl combine 1/2 cup of the warm liquid with the yeast.  Mix well and allow to sit for 2 – 3 minutes.
Add the yeast to the large bowl of flour along with 3 1/2 cups of additional water.  Mix well and knead the dough for approximately 7 – 10 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the bowl and continue to knead.  Watch video here,  to see what the dough should look like. Shape the dough into a ball and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Place in a warm, draft-free place and allow to rise for approximately 2 hours or until doubled in size.
To prepare the koulourakia take approximately 1 tablespoon of dough and roll it on a clean surface to make a strip which is approximately 6 to 8 inches long. Pinch the ends together to make it round.  Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and allow to rise for an additional 20 – 30 minutes.

Using a mixer, beat together the sugar, and oil for 5 minutes.  Add the orange juice, and mix for another couple of minutes (if you don’t have a stand mixer, a hand held mixer will do nicely).
Add in the ouzo and mix again, for a minute or so.  (If you're using liquid vanilla, add 2 teaspoons in this step)
In a medium size bowl, add 2 cups of your sifted flour.  Sift and add the baking powder, and vanilla powder (if you're using it).  Whisk together to combine.
Add this flour, baking powder and vanilla powder combination to your mixing bowl, containing the sugar/oil ingredients; and with your bread hook attachment, mix well to combine. 
Remove 1/2 cup of your measured sifted flour and keep aside.  You probably won't need it.
Continue to add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing well  after each addition. Alternatively, at this point, if you choose, you can use your hands to knead the dough.  
The dough should be soft and almost pillowy, but should hold its shape and be easy to roll. Watch video here. You want to avoid adding in too much flour.  You want to get to the point just where the dough is pulling away from the side of the mixing bowl, as it's mixing. As soon as you have about 2 cups of flour left, add it slowly.   As soon as you see the dough pulling away from the side, it's done.  Watch video here.  If you're not sure, don't add the extra flour you set aside.   Let the dough rest for about 10-20 minutes. Here's another video.
Take about 1 tablespoon (32 grams) of dough and make a log about 6 inches long. Keep in mind, that the dough will feel oily..this is ok.  It's a greasy dough. Then, create a thin “S” shape. Place on parchment lined cookie sheet and bake in middle rack of oven for about 25 minutes, turning halfway.
If you are going to use the sesame seeds, spread some of them on the counter or cutting board (wherever you will be rolling your koulourakia).  Roll out your dough and create your log on top of the sesame seeds; this way they will get embedded in the dough. Continue as above: Create an “S” shape.  Try not to let the ends of the cookie become too thin, because they will burn during baking. Place on parchment lined paper and bake in middle rack of oven for about 25 minutes.  Here's a video of our mom shaping them.
When the koulourakia are golden brown on the underside, and puffy and golden on top, they are ready.
Allow them to rest for about a minute and then remove from the cookie sheet and allow to cool on a cooling rack.
