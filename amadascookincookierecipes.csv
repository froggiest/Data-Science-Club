Watch it carefully, it can burn quickly. Turn the coconut out onto a piece of paper towel and let it cool.
Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Toss in the coconut until combined.
In a medium bowl, using your fingers, rub the orange zest into the granulated sugar. It will be fragrant and moist.

Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, beating just until evenly combined. If you have to, use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine any remaining flour.
Lay 2 large pieces of parchment paper on a clean work surface and put half of the dough along the center of each piece. Shape the dough into 2 logs measuring about 1 1/2-inches in diameter and 10-inches long. Roll logs up in the parchment and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 F and position rack in the center of the oven.
Cut the logs into 1/2-inch slices. Roll the edges of the cookies in sugar to coat and shake off excess. Arrange on a baking sheet, leaving 1/2-inch between the cookies. 
Bake until set and golden on the edges, about 13 to 18 minutes. Place parchment paper underneath wire cooling racks, then transfer the cookies to the racks to cool completely. 
Place the chopped chocolate and shortening in a glass or metal bowl and place it over a pot of simmering water (about an inch or so of water). The bowl should not touch the water. 
Stir chocolate and shortening with a rubber spatula until smooth. Dip half of each cookie into the chocolate, shake off excess, and set on a cooling rack. Now is the time to add optional garnishes such as extra orange zest or toasted coconut.
Allow the chocolate dipped cookies to harden at room temperature. If you are short on time, you can pop them in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to help them set up quickly.

In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add dry ingredients to the creamed mixture. Stir until a soft dough forms.
Separate the dough into two batches. One batch I separated into 4 pieces and the other batch into 6 pieces. The batch of 6 I used paste gel food coloring to tint each section a color of the rainbow. In case you don't remember, those colors are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo (purple).
For the other 4 pieces I tinted two of them green, one darker than the other, and the other two yellow, again, one darker than the other. In hindsight, the yellows didn't end up looking any different, so if you want there to be some contrast, add a bit of orange to one of the yellow batches. The green dough is for the shamrocks and the yellow is for the gold coins.
Chill the dough wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for two hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F when you start shaping the cookies.
The gold coins are the easiest. Take your two different yellows, roll a 3/4"" ball of each one, then gently roll the two balls together. Don't go crazy, just roll them enough to combine the two. Using the palms of both hands, roll into a snake, about 10-12"" long. Start at one end and roll the snake into a spiral cookie.
To make the shamrock cookies you'll need three green discs.
Take your two different shades of green and roll a 3/4"" ball of each one, then gently roll the two balls together. Again, don't go crazy, just roll them enough to combine the two. Using the palms of both hands, roll into a snake, about 10-12"" long.
Next, where the coil ends, pinch the disc into a point.
Use a butter knife or a lollipop stick to create a dent at the opposite end, forming a heart shape.
Place the 3 green hearts together and insert a lollipop stick.
For the rainbows, simply roll colored dough into snakes. The smallest being purple and the largest red, just curve them around each other and insert a stick.
To make the rainbow twisted coiled cookies, you will need a 1/2"" ball of each rainbow colored dough.
Gently combine them into one ball. From here, you can simply roll into a snake then a coil and be done.TIP – If the dough snake breaks a couple times, don't worry! Just pinch it back together it will bake up just fine.

Meanwhile, prepare the caramel by placing all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat.
Whisk constantly until the mixture is fully melted and comes to a boil (do not increase the temperature.) *Be sure to stir the caramel constantly and keep the heat at or just below medium so that the caramel doesn’t burn on the bottom of the pan.

Add the cream cheese into the food processor and process until the mixture is fully combined and clumps into a “dough.”
Use a tablespoon or a cookie dough scoop to make balls of the mixture and place each ball on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Chill in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to firm the dough a bit.Freezing the dough balls for a short period of time is really helpful to get them firm enough to hold their shape for dipping, but if they are overly cold, the chocolate coating may crack. This can happen when the warm coating comes into contact with the very cold center – the center expands and the coating cracks or the insides start squirting out a hole in the coating. About 15 minutes in the freezer should be a good balance between cold enough and not too cold.
Roll each ball between the palms of your hands to form a smooth ball. Place the tray back into the freezer for an additional 10-15 minutes or the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Place the melting wafers and chocolate chips in separate microwave-safe bowls and heat in 30 second increments, stirring between each interval, until the chocolate is melted through and is smooth. You can do one type of dipping chocolate at a time so that the other doesn’t harden while you’re dipping the first half of the balls.
Working on one ball at a time, dip the firm ball into the melted chocolate, tossing it to coat completely. Lift from the chocolate using a fork. Tap off excess chocolate and place the ball on a clean sheet of parchment paper.TIP – If the chocolate starts to harden or thicken while dipping, place it back into the microwave in 15 second increments and stir until smooth. You can also add a teaspoon of shortening to the chocolate when heating it to help thin it so it smooths out over the chocolate evenly. 
Continue dipping half of the truffles in white chocolate and half of the truffles in semi-sweet chocolate.

Use a greased spatula or fingers to pat the shortbread mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 30-35 minutes until shortbread is golden brown around the edges and set in the center. Cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the caramel by placing all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat.
Whisk constantly until the mixture is fully melted and comes to a boil (do not increase the temperature.)*Be sure to stir the caramel constantly and keep the heat at or just below medium so that the caramel doesn’t burn on the bottom of the pan.
Fit the saucepan with a candy thermometer and continue whisking and cooking until the caramel reaches the soft ball stage, 225°F. This process can take 20-30 minutes.
Remove the caramel from the heat and pour over the baked shortbread, spreading it smooth to the edges.
Chill for at least 30 minutes to firm up the caramel so that it does not displace when the ganache is added.
To make the ganache, combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring/whisking between intervals until the chocolate melts and the ganache comes together in a thick, smooth mixture.
Spread the ganache over the caramel. Sprinkle flakey sea salt over the top of the ganache and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes or until the ganache is set.

With the mixer at low speed, add the flour mixture incorporating until no traces of flour remain. Do NOT add peanut butter chips, you will use them in a later step, before the cookies go into the oven.
Use a large cookie scoop (3 tablespoons), to portion out all cookies onto a wax paper lined plate or tray. Place dough balls into the refrigerator for 30 minutes.TIP: The dough is sticky at room temperature. Chilling the dough makes it much easier to handle.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 F. Line insulated baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove dough balls from refrigerator. Using gloved hands, slightly flatten dough ball and place half a frozen marshmallow into the center. Press in in gently and gather the dough up around the sides of the marshmallow, carefully pressing the dough together to completely close in the marshmallow.TIP: Since the melted marshmallow will seep out, you want the marshmallow to be closer to the top of the cookie rather than the bottom.
NOTE: It’s best to keep the marshmallows frozen for as long as you can. Only bring out enough for the batch you are putting in the oven. Keeping them frozen will keep them from melting too quickly while the cookie bakes.
Place some peanut butter chips into the palm of one hand. I found that 9 chips per cookie (placed close together) was the magic number.

Divide dough in half and wrap each half in plastic and let stand at room temperature for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours. 
Preheat oven to 375°. Grease or line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Place 1 portion of the dough on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle flour over dough and rolling pin. Roll dough to a scant 1/4-inch thick. Use additional flour to avoid sticking.
Cut out cookies with desired cutter. It’s easiest to roll the dough out on the parchment, cut out the cookies and remove the outer pieces, leaving the cookie shapes on the parchment. Then lift the parchment up at one side, so that the cookie shape is now upside down, place your hand under it and peel the parchment off the back of the cookie. The cookie will land gently in your hand and won’t get stretched out of shape like it would if you lift the cookie from the surface and place it on the pan.

Shortbread Cookies,Amanda Davis,5, 23 ,American,Desserts,"Cookies, Brownies, & Bars",NA,15 minutes,NA,35 minutes,35 minutes,50 cookies,8,"Beat the butter at medium speed until smooth and very creamy. Add the sugars and salt and beat until well blended, about 1 minute. The mixture should be smooth and velvety, not fluffy and airy. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in 2 of the egg yolks, again beating until the mixture is homogeneous.
Turn off the mixer. Pour in the flour, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and the counter from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek -- if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple more times; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough and the dough looks uniformly moist. (If most of the flour is incorporated but you've still got some in the bottom of the bowl, use a rubber spatula to work the rest of the flour into the dough.) The dough will not clean the sides of the bowl, nor will it come together in a ball -- and it shouldn't. You want to work the dough as little as possible. What you're aiming for is a soft, moist, clumpy (rather than smooth) dough. Pinch it, and it will feel a little like Play-Doh.
Scrape the dough out onto a smooth work surface, gather it into a ball and divide it in half. Shape each piece into a smooth log about 9 inches long: it's easiest to work on a piece of plastic wrap and use the plastic to help form the log. Wrap the logs well and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours, preferably longer. 
GETTING READY TO BAKE: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.
Remove a log of dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it and place it on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Whisk the remaining egg yolk until it is smooth, and brush some of the yolk all over the sides of the dough -- this is the glue -- then sprinkle the entire surface of the log with decorating sugar.
Trim the ends of the roll if they're ragged, and slice the log into 1/3-inch-thick cookies. Place the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving an inch of space between them.
Bake one sheet at a time for 17 to 20 minutes, rotating the baking sheet at the midway point. When properly baked, the cookies will be light brown on the bottom, lightly golden around the edges and pale on top; they may feel tender when you touch the top gently, and that's fine. Remove from the oven and let the cookies rest a minute or two before carefully lifting them onto a rack with a wide metal spatula to cool to room temperature.
Repeat with the remaining log of dough, making sure the baking sheets are cool before you bake the second batch.",7,▢ 1 cup unsalted butter softened,▢ ½ cup granulated sugar,▢ ¼ cup confectioners' sugar sifted,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ 3 large egg yolks divided,▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,▢ course sugar or nonpareils optional,NA,NA,NA,NA,Amanda's Cookin,https://amandascookin.com/shortbread-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Grandma’s Sugar Cookies,Amanda Davis,5, 61 ,American,Desserts,"Cookies, Brownies, & Bars",NA,11 minutes,NA,26 minutes,26 minutes,50 cookies,7,"Whisk the flour, salt and baking powder together and keep close by.
Working in a mixer with the paddle attachment, if you have one, beat the butter at medium speed for a minute or so, until it is smooth. Still beating, add the sugar and continue to beat for about 2 minutes, until the butter is light and pale. Add the egg and the yolk and the vanilla and beat another minute or two. Reduce the mixer speed to low and steadily add the flour mixture, mixing only until it has been incorporated. In fact, because this dough is best when worked least, you might want to stop the mixer before all the flour is thoroughly blended into the dough and finish the job with a rubber spatula. When mixed, the dough will be soft, creamy and appealingly malleable.
Turn the dough out onto a counter and divide it in half. If you want to make roll-out cookies, shape each half into a disk and wrap in plastic. If you want to make slice-and-bake cookies, shape each half into a chubby sausage (the diameter of the sausage is up to you - I usually like cookies that are about 2 inches or more across) and wrap in plastic. Whether you're going to roll or slice the dough, the packets must be chilled for at least 2 hours. 
Getting ready to bake the cookies: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have two lined baking sheets at the ready. For these, I prefer to bake a single sheet at a time. You can fill both sheets and keep one sheet covered in the refrigerator while you bake the other.
If you are making slice-and-bake cookies, use a ruler to mark off 1/4-inch intervals on each roll of dough. With a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the dough into rounds and place the rounds on one of the baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of space between each cookie.
If you are making roll-out cookies, work with one packet of dough at a time and roll the dough between sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper to a thickness of 1/4 inch, lifting the plastic or paper and turning the dough over often so that it rolls evenly. Lift off the top sheet of plastic or paper and cut the cookies - I like a 2-inch round cookie cutter for these. Pull away the excess dough, saving the scraps for re-rolling, and carefully lift the rounds onto the baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of space between each cookie. (This is a soft dough and you might have trouble peeling away the excess or lifting the cut outs. If so, cover the dough, chill it for about 15 minutes and try again.) After you've rolled and cut the second packet of dough, you can form the scraps into a disk, chill, roll, cut and bake them.
Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for 9 to 11 minutes, rotating the sheet at the mid-point. The cookies should feel firm, but they should not color much if at all. Remove the pan from the oven and dust the cookies with sugar or cinnamon-sugar, if you'd like.
