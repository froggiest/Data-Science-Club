Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment (or a hand mixer), beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, then add the cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla extract.
Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat to soft peaks. While continuing to beat the egg whites, gradually add the granulated sugar and beat until glossy and stiff peaks form.
Fit a pastry bag with a large star tip (I use the Ateco #827 for an open star, the Ateco #864 for a French star) and fill it with meringue.
Pipe the cookies onto the prepared baking sheet. You do not need to leave much room between the cookies, as they will not spread.
Bake the cookies for 1 hour, or until firm to the touch. Turn the oven off and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon until the cookies are completely cool. (I usually bake them in the evening and then leave them in the propped-open oven overnight to cool and set up completely.)
Carefully remove from the parchment and store in an airtight container at room temperature, keeping them away from excess heat or moisture (it will cause them to become chewy).",5,"▢ 4 egg whites, at room temperature",▢ ½ teaspoon cream of tartar,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ Pinch of salt,▢ 1 cup (198 g) granulated sugar,Brown Eyed Baker,https://www.browneyedbaker.com/classic-meringue-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Making the Icings: Melt the chocolate either in a medium bowl set over a small saucepan over barely-simmering water, or using the microwave on 50% power in 30-second increments; set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the water and corn syrup to a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Transfer ¾ cup of the icing to the bowl with the melted chocolate and whisk to combine.
Ice the Cookies: Place wire racks over wax paper to catch any drips. Use a small offset spatula to spread about 2 tablespoons of the vanilla icing onto half of the flat underside of each cookie. The icing should move on its own when the cookie is tilted; use the spatula to scrape any excess from around the edges. If the vanilla begins to thicken too much, stir in a teaspoon of warm water at a time until the icing goes back to a smoother, looser consistency. Place the finished cookies on the wire racks and allow to set for at least 15 minutes.
Again using a small offset spatula, spread the chocolate icing on the half of each cookie, scraping any excess icing from around the edge of the cookies. If the chocolate icing thickens too much, place the bowl on a small saucepan of barely simmering water so that it can re-melt. If it’s still too thick, you can add warm water, a teaspoon at a time, until it returns to the correct consistency. Place the finished cookies on the wire racks and allow to set for at least 1 hour.

5. To make the icing: Add the powdered sugar to a heatproof bowl. Put the butter in a small saucepan over medium heet and let it start melting. Continue cooking, swirling occasionally, until the butter becomes golden brown and smells nutty (be paitent and watch carefully, it can go from brown to burnt quickly). Remove it from the heat and pour it over the powdered sugar, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the half-and-half and vanilla and stir until the icing is smooth. Using a small offset spatula, spread icing on each cookie. (If the icing stiffens before you get them all frosted, stir vigorously to lighten it up.)
Note #1: You can substitute evaporated milk for the half-and-half in both the cookies and the icing.
Note #2: If you don't have a cookie scoop, transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitting with a plain tip (or use a ziploc bag with the corner snipped off) and pipe 1½-inch rounds onto the prepared baking sheet.",17,▢ 2¾ cups (343.75 g) all-purpose flour,▢ 1 teaspoon baking powder,▢ 1 teaspoon baking soda,▢ 1¼ teaspoons (1.25 teaspoons) kosher salt,▢ 1½ teaspoons (1.5 teaspoons) ground cinnamon,Brown Eyed Baker,https://www.browneyedbaker.com/pumpkin-cookies-with-brown-butter-icing/,▢ 1¼ teaspoons (1.25 teaspoons) ground ginger,▢ ¾ teaspoon (0.75 teaspoon) ground nutmeg,"▢ ¾ cup (170.25 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature, (6 ounces )",▢ 2¼ cups (495 g) light brown sugar,"▢ 2 eggs, at room temperature",▢ 1½ cups (367.5 g) canned pumpkin,▢ ¾ cup (177.44 ml) half-and-half,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 4 cups (480 g) powdered sugar,▢ 10 tablespoons unsalted butter,▢ ¼ cup (59 ml) plus 1 tablespoon half-and-half,▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Homemade Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches,Michelle Lettrich,5,1 ,Snack,American,20 minutes,NA,NA,NA,12 ice cream sandwiches,5,"1. Make the ice cream and bake the cookies. Let the ice cream sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to soften.
2. Turn one cookie over and place one (for a thin ice cream layer) or two (for a thicker ice cream layer) scoops of the ice cream onto the bottom of the cookie.
3. Place another cookie (right-side-up) on top of the ice cream and squeeze them together a bit to push the ice cream to the edges. Roll the edges in sprinkles, chocolate chips or nuts. Eat immediately or wrap in plastic wrap and place in freezer bag to eat later. (I personally think ice cream sandwiches are best eaten when they are freshly assembled.)

Cut in the shortening with a fork or pastry blender and work the mixture until it looks like cornmeal.
In a separate bowl whisk together the egg, vanilla, and milk.
Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix with an electric mixer for a full 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.
Remove the dough from the mixer and knead by hand for 5 minutes.
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, wrap each with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.
To make the filling, grind figs, dates, and raisins in a food processor until coarse.
Place fig, date, and raisin mixture in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Mixture will be thick. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 375° and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Work with one piece of dough at a time, leaving the remaining pieces in the refrigerator until needed. On a floured surface roll the dough into a 12-inch square. Cut dough into 2x3-inch rectangles. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of filling into the middle of each rectangle. Carefully fold the short edges over to meet in the center and pinch to seal. Seal the sides as well.
Place each cookie, seam-side down, on a baking sheet, leaving 1-2 inches between each cookie.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are golden in color.
Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely before icing.
For the icing, mix together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and enough milk to achieve the desired consistency. You'll want the icing to be thick enough not to be runny, but still easily spreadable. Ice the tops of the cookies and decorate with sprinkles, if desired. Let the icing set completely before storing in an airtight container.",19,▢ 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour,▢ 1½ tablespoons (1.5 tablespoons) baking powder,▢ ¼ teaspoon (0.25 teaspoon) salt,▢ ½ cup (100 g) sugar,▢ 1 cup (205 g) vegetable shortening,Brown Eyed Baker,https://www.browneyedbaker.com/cucidati-italian-fig-cookies/,▢ 1 egg,▢ 1 tablespoon vanilla extract,▢ ½ cup (122 ml) milk,▢ 1 cup (149 g) dried figs,"▢ 1 cup (147 g) dried dates, pitted",▢ ¾ cup (108.75 g) raisins,"▢ ½ cup (58.5 g) walnuts, chopped or ground in food processor",▢ ½ teaspoon (0.5 teaspoon) ground cinnamon,▢ ¼ cup (84.75 ml) honey,▢ ¼ cup (80 g) orange marmalade,▢ 2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"▢ 4 tablespoons milk, approximately","▢ Colored sprinkles, optional",NA,NA,NA,NA

Chocolate Biscotti,Michelle Lettrich,NA,NA,Snack,Italian,25 minutes,35 minutes,NA,1 hour hr,24 biscotti,7,"1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat.
2. Sift together the flour, cocoa, espresso powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
3. Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed until pale, about 2 minutes; the mixture may be crumbly. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs and vanilla and beat for another 2 minutes; don't worry if the mixture looks curdled. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in the dry ingredients in 3 additions, mixing only until a dough forms. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix in the chopped nuts and chocolate, then turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead in any dry ingredients that  might have escaped mixing.
4. Divide the dough in half. Working with one half at a time, roll the dough into 12-inch-long logs. Flatten both logs with the palm of your hand, so that they are ½ to 1 inch high, about 2 inches across and sort of rectangular, then carefully lift the logs onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle each log with a little sugar.
5. Bake the logs for about 25 minutes, or until they are just slightly firm. The logs will spread and crack - and that's just fine. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, put it on a cooling rack and cool the logs for about 20 minutes. (Leave the oven on.)
6. Working with one log at a time, using a long serrated knife, cut each log into slices between ½ and ¾ inch thick. Stand the slices up on the baking sheet - you'll have an army of biscotti - and baking the cookies again, this time for just 10 minutes.

Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, depending on oven. Check often to prevent over cooking or burning. Cool on baking rack when done.
Meanwhile, prepare frosting – it’s a MUST for these cookies! (go all the way or not at all)
Cream butter, milk and vanilla together.
Slowly add powdered sugar to butter until desired consistency. If you’d like, add liquid food coloring for festive cookies.  Note: I had some trouble with the icing and needed to add a little more milk to thin it out and make it spreadable, but I may have done something wrong ;-)
