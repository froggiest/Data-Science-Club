Boil exactly 1 minute. Once it begins boiling, set a timer for 1 minute. Keep stirring while it bubbles. Timing is critical — less than 1 minute and the cookies may not set — longer than 1 minute and they may become dry and crumbly.
Remove from heat and stir in flavorings. Take the pan off the stove. Stir in vanilla extract and peanut butter until smooth and fully incorporated.

Scoop the dough onto parchment paper lined, light-colored baking sheets, spaced at least two inches apart.
Bake for 9-12 minutes or until the edges are a light golden color.

Place butter in large pot or deep skillet. Melt butter over medium-low heat. The butter will go through different phases. It will begin to melt and bubble. Take a wooden spoon or spatula and stir often and around the sides of the pan. Let the butter melt and watch for it to begin changing colors from a creamy yellow to a amber yellow. The butter will begin to foam. Small brown bits will begin to form and that will be a signal that the butter is officially browned. Butter can burn quickly so watch carefully. It is better to pull off of the heat a little early instead of browning too long and risk burning it.
ADD SUGARS. Once browned, immediately remove the butter from the heat and either set it aside to cool for 5 minutes or pour it into a heat-proof bowl to cool slightly before mixing in the sugars. Stir in brown sugar and sugar and mix until it is smooth and resembles caramel. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes before adding the egg yolks.
ADD EGG YOLKS and VANILLA. Add the vanilla and whisk into the butter sugar mixture. Before adding the egg yolks, ensure the mixture isn't too hot.
BLOT PUMPKIN PUREE. Blotting the pumpkin puree is a crucial step for these cookies. Canned pumpkin contains a lot of moisture, which can make your cookies cakey if it’s not removed. Measure out a generous 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin puree and spread it on paper towels. Place another paper towel on top of the puree and gently press down to absorb excess moisture. Fold in pumpkin puree.
FOLD in DRY INGREDIENTS. Fold in flour, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.
ADD CHOCOLATE CHIPS. Make sure the cookie dough isn't too warm before adding the chocolate chips. Keep out 1/4 cup of chocolate chips to place on top of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven.
CHILL COOKIE DOUGH. I suggest chilling the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes.
BAKE COOKIES. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop out cookie dough balls and place them on the light-colored baking sheets, leaving space between them for spreading. Bake until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft about 9-13 minutes.

Edible Cookie Dough,Melissa Stadler,"on Aug 23, 2024",5,5,American,"edible chocolate chip cookie dough, edible cookie dough",20 minutes,NA,NA,NA,Servings: 8,8,"Melt Butter. There are two ways to melt the butter…browning the butter in a saucepan or melting the butter in the microwave. The microwave will take less time but I suggest using 50% power to keep the butter from splattering (in the photo below, I microwaved the butter in a microwave-safe bowl.
If browning the butter, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Watch carefully as the butter melts and starts to turn a deeper color. Don't overcook or you risk burning the butter and too much liquid evaporating. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Whisk sugars into the butter. This is an important step to add the brown sugar and sugar while the butter is still warm, not hot. When sugars are whisked together with butter, the heat from the butter begins to melt the sugars, creating a smooth and glossy mixture. The sugars starts to dissolve and the brown sugar adds a deeper, caramel flavor. Set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes.
Treat (heat) the Flour. When making edible cookie dough, the best way to treat the flour to ensure it’s safe to eat is by heating it to kill any potential bacteria. There are two ways you can do it — in the oven or in the microwave. See the notes below on the two options and how to do it.
Once the butter and sugar mixture has slightly cooled, add vanilla extract and milk and mix until smooth.
Fold in flour. If you are using salted butter, you may not need salt. If you are using unsalted butter, add 1/8 teaspoon. Check the temperature of the dough BEFORE adding the chocolate chips or if it is too warm, the chocolate chips will melt.
Eat the dough right away or cover and let it chill in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes to allow it to set-up more.

Cut the strawberries into small pieces or into slices, depending on preference. Arrange the sliced strawberries on top of the frosted cookies or sprinkle the fresh strawberries over the frosting.

Add cubed butter. See below in the notes for tips on how to brown the butter. Once the butter has become a golden color, remove from heat.
Carefully add brown sugar and sugar and stir with a wooden spoon, spatula, or whisk until glossy and smooth. This may take several minutes and this helps to cool the butter slightly. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to cool at room temperature.
After it has time to slightly cool, stir in vanilla until smooth. Add egg and egg yolk and stir together.

Since we are using melted browned butter, it is imperative to chill the cookie dough or you will end up with flat cookies. I suggest wrapping the cookie dough and chilling for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. If time is on your hand, I suggest chilling for 24-48 hours.

I suggest cutting it into cubes. Melt butter over medium-low heat. The butter will begin to melt and bubble. Take a wooden spoon or spatula and stir often and around the sides of the pan. Let the butter melt and watch for it to begin to change colors from a creamy yellow to a deep amber yellow. The butter will begin to foam and this is why it is important to stir often so you can see what is going on with the melted butter below the foam. You will start to see small browned bits that will begin to form and it will be a signal that the butter is officially browned. Butter can burn quickly so WATCH CAREFULLY. It is better to pull off of the heat a little early instead of browning too long and risking burning it.
Add the brown sugar and sugar and whisk for several minutes until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Let cool at room temperature for 15 minutes.* If the mixture isn't completely smooth, the addition of the eggs will help to create a smooth texture.

Melt butter over medium-low heat. The butter will go through different phases. It will begin to melt and bubble. Take a wooden spoon or spatula and stir often and around the sides of the pan. Let the butter melt and watch for it to begin changing colors from a creamy yellow to a deep amber yellow. The butter will begin to foam and this is why it is important to stir often so you can see what is going on below the foam. Small brown bits will begin to form and that will be a signal that the butter is officially browned. Butter can burn quickly so watch carefully. It is better to pull off of the heat a little early instead of browning too long and risk burning it.
Place the brown sugar and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Pour the browned butter into the bowl, scraping the pot to get all of the browned bits. Whisk for several minutes until the mixture is smooth and shiny. * If the mixture isn't completely smooth, the addition of the eggs will help to create a smooth texture. Let cool at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Add eggs and vanilla and whisk together until smooth and creamy.
Fold in flour, baking soda, and salt. Check to ensure the cookie dough isn't too warm before adding the chocolate and toffee bits or they will melt.
Fold in the chocolate chunks or chips and toffee bits. It is important to chill the dough to allow the mixture to set up and ingredients to incorporate together. Wrap the cookie dough tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill. Another option is to scoop the cookie dough with a cookie scoop into balls and cover and chill in the refrigerator.
I suggest chilling the dough for 24-48 hours. If you want an expedited version, you can chill the dough for 1-2 hours.
When ready to bake, if you wrapped the entire amount of dough in plastic wrap, allow the cookie dough to come to room temperature.This will help when rolling the dough. Smooth out the tops with your fingers.

When working with white chocolate, the key is to slowly melt it. You can use a double boiler or microwave method. If using the microwave, use only 40-50% power and cook at 30 second increments.

It usually takes less than a minute to melt white chocolate, depending how much you are melting at one time. Stir the white chocolate after each time to see if it's ready.
