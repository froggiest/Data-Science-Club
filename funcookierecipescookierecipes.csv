Gently fold half of the sifted dry ingredients into the meringue. Once combined, add the remaining dry ingredients. Add brown gel food coloring to achieve the desired color. Continue folding until the batter flows like ribbons and you can make a figure 8 without the batter breaking.
Line baking sheets with silicone mats. Fill a piping bag fitted with a round tip with the batter. Pipe onto the mats following a template. Tap the baking sheet to remove air bubbles and pop any remaining bubbles with a toothpick.
Bake: Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Let the macarons dry for 40-45 minutes until a skin forms. Bake each tray for 13-14 minutes. Allow to cool completely on the mat before removing.
Make the Buttercream: While macarons bake, prepare the buttercream. Squeeze excess moisture from pumpkin puree using paper towels. Cream together pumpkin puree, butter, cream cheese, and brown sugar. Gradually add powdered sugar and spices until you achieve a pipeable consistency.
Pair macaron shells by size. Pipe buttercream on one shell of each pair and sandwich together. Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before decorating.
Decorate: Melt butterscotch chips and use a toothpick to apply to the back of candy eyes and a butterscotch chip for the beak. Add candy corns to the buttercream for tail feathers.
Store: Keep macarons in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Allow them to mature for 24 hours for optimal flavor.

Christmas Tree Cake Macarons,Diana,"November 3, 2022",NA,5,16,Macarons,Christmas Tree Cake Macarons,40 minutes,15 minutes,NA,10 minutes,20 macarons,17,"Measure the almond flour and powdered sugar (by weight, please!) and sift them into a bowl. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine room temperature egg whites and cream of tartar and whisk until frothy (1-2 minutes). Gradually add in the granulated sugar (1 tablespoon at a time) and mix until stiff peaks form (7-9 minutes). The meringue should stick straight up when you remove the whisk.
Sift half of the almond flour and powdered sugar into the meringue and fold by going around the bowl and straight through the center of the meringue. Continue folding until there are no dry spots remaining. Sift in the remaining almond and powdered sugar mixture and fold until you get a “lava-like” consistency (about 60 folds, this is not accurate but a good starting point). You should be able to pick up your spatula and draw a figure 8 with the batter without it breaking off. The batter should also disappear back into the bulk after about 15-20 seconds. Be careful not to overmix the batter or you will lose air bubbles from the egg whites.
Prepare a piping bag with a large round tip. Use a large mug or glass to hold the piping bag while you fill with the macaron batter. Add a silicone mat or parchment paper to a baking sheet. Holding the piping bag straight up, pipe about 1 ½” circles of batter.
Next, tap the baking sheet 5 times against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles that come to the surface.
This step is very important. Allow the shells to set for about 20-40 minutes or until a “skin” forms on the outside (it might take longer depending on your environment). You should be able to touch the top of the shells without batter coming off on your finger. The macaron shells are ready to bake, when they are no longer tacky.
Preheat the oven to 300°F/150°C while the macarons are drying. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until you can touch the top of the shell and it does not move around on the “feet”. You may need to rotate the pan midway if you know that your oven has cold spots. Otherwise, do not open the oven until 13 minutes have gone by. The macarons are done when they have puffed up and no longer stick to the silicone pan or parchment paper.
Remove the macaron shells from the oven and allow them to cool COMPLETELY before trying to remove them from the pan.
While the macarons are cooling, prepare the buttercream by adding the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and cream until nice and smooth.
Add in powdered sugar one cup at a time and fully incorporate.
Pour in heavy whipping cream and slowly increase speed to high and whip for 2-3 minutes until you get a whipped consistency.
Add in the crumbled Christmas tree cakes last and mix on high speed until combined and smooth.
Add to a piping bag with a large round piping tip, I used Wilton #1A.
Flip over half of the shells and pipe a small amount of buttercream on each shell and top with the remaining shells.
Dip the top of one of the shells into white chocolate and sprinkle with green sprinkles. Repeat with half of the shells.
Use a small piping tip and pipe red lines of buttercream or royal icing on top of the white chocolate. Use a cake as a reference.
Place in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to “mature” this will give you the best results.

Add in flour mixture and mix until fully blended using an electric mixer. Be sure to scrape the edges of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Your gingerbread dough should be smooth and velvety to the touch.
Chill the dough for at least three hours or overnight. Do not skip this step!
When the dough is properly chilled and ready for use, preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C and prepare a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Roll dough out to about ¼ of an inch using a clean rolling pin.
Cut out gingerbread man shapes using a clean cookie cutter. Be sure to make your cuts close to one another to use as much dough as possible. You can re-roll the scraps of dough and repeat the cutting process, but you don't want to do this too many times.

Place room temperature egg whites and granulated sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on low speed for 1-2 minutes, then increase the speed to medium-high and continue beating for 7-9 minutes, or until the egg whites reach the stiff peaks phase. Add the food coloring and vanilla or almond extract and mix just to combine.
Fold in a third of the dry ingredients to the egg white mixture with a spatula until completely mixed. Fold in the rest of the ingredients until the batter can run off the spatula forming a “figure-8” without breaking. Be careful not to overmix the batter or you will lose air bubbles from the egg whites.
Add the macaron mixture to a large piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe circles onto a silicone mat that is on a cookie sheet, keeping them the same size and shape, and 1-2 inches apart. Use parchment paper if you do not have a silicone mat. Tap the pan on the counter at least 5 times to release air bubbles, then use a toothpick to remove any air bubbles that pop up on the surface of your macarons.
Allow the cookies to rest. This step is very important. Set the pan of macarons aside and allow it to rest for 20-40 minutes at room temperature. This time will vary based on the temperature of your kitchen and the humidity in the air. The cookies are ready to bake when the tops are no longer tacky. They should appear smooth and dry.
Preheat the oven to 280°F/140°C while the macarons are drying. Then bake the macarons in the preheated oven for 15-17 minutes. If your oven has cold spots, you may need to rotate the pan mid-way. Otherwise, do not open the oven until 13 minutes have gone by. The macarons are done when they have puffed up and no longer stick to the silicone pan or parchment paper.
Place the pan on top of a cooling rack and allow the macarons to cool for 10 minutes. Then remove the silpat or parchment from the pan and set that on the cooling rack to allow the macarons to cool completely.
