In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter until it is smooth. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy.
Scrape down the bowl, then add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Beat on low speed, then increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Turn off the mixer and add half of the flour. Mix on low speed just until incorporated, then continue to mix on medium speed until no flour remains. Add the rest of the flour and beat until combined, scraping down the bowl as needed.
Turn the dough out onto the counter. Bring the dough into a flat disc, divide evenly in half, and wrap each half in plastic. Refrigerate the wrapped dough discs for 30 minutes.
Take one disc from the refrigerator and leave the other one in. Between two sheets of parchment paper, roll out the dough evenly to 1/8-inch thick. You may need to tape the parchment in place before rolling, or place a silicone baking mat underneath the parchment to help anchor it. Leave the rolled dough in the parchment and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and keep them near your workstation. Arrange an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F.
Peel back the top sheet of parchment on the chilled rolled dough and set aside to use on the next round, or discard it if needed. Use a 2.5-inch heart cutter to cut as many hearts as possible from the dough. Use a 1-inch heart cutter to cut little hearts out of the center of half of the hearts. These will be the tops of the cookies. Transfer the hearts to a prepared baking sheet. Gather the scraps of dough into a disc, wrap, and refrigerate.
Bake the cookies for 6 to 7 minutes, until they are pale golden brown.
Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and cool completely. In a small bowl, stir to combine the raspberry jam, rose water, and lemon juice. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon jam on each of the whole heart cookies. Spread the jam slightly, keeping most of it mounded in the center of the heart.
Dust the hearts with the cut out in the middle of them lightly with confectioners' sugar, then place them on top of the jam-topped bottom hearts.
Repeat with the rest of the refrigerated dough, rolling, chilling, cutting out, baking, and assembling.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.
In the mixing bowl of a stand mixer or hand-held mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and anise extracts. 
Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and beat until just combined. Stir in the nuts and dried fruit (or any other add-ins); the dough will be thick.
Turn out the dough on the counter. Moisten your hands lightly with water to keep them from sticking to the dough, and divide the dough into two equal portions. Shape each into a long log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. This seems very narrow but the dough will spread as it bakes. Place logs on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they are spaced apart.
Make the egg wash by whisking the egg and a teaspoon of water in a small bowl. Brush the tops and sides of the logs evenly with the egg wash. Sprinkle the logs evenly with the 2 tablespoons sugar.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the logs are pale golden brown, springy to the touch with a cracked surface. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and lower the oven temperature to 300°F.
Gently slide an offset spatula under each loaf to loosen it from the parchment, then cool in place on the parchment for 15 minutes. Transfer the loaves to the rack off the baking sheet and parchment to cool for another 20 minutes.
Transfer a cooled loaf to a cutting board. Use a serrated knife to cut slices on the diagonal, about 3/4-inch thick. Arrange the slices, cut-side-up, on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown.

Remove the pan from the oven and immediately sprinkle the flakey sea salt evenly over the top of the brownies. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the parchment sling to lift the entire brownie block from the pan.
Allow the brownies to cool completely to ensure they cut cleanly, at least 1 hour. The longer the brownies cool, the more cleanly they will cut.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate chips, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the granulated sugar and espresso powder.
Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition. Stir in the flour, salt, and cocoa powder until combined. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until the edges begin to pull away and a toothpick inserted in the middle of the pan yields just a few moist crumbs, about 35 minutes. Cool completely.
In a medium bowl or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.

Sitto’s Date Ma’amoul,Maureen Abood,5,3,Lebanese Recipes,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,24 2-inch cookies,14,"In a stand mixer or using a hand-held mixer, beat the butter in a large bowl until it’s creamy and light, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk, vanilla, orange blossom water, and whiskey. Beat again until the mixture is thick and creamy, another 3 minutes.
Sift into the butter mixture the confectioner’s sugar, cake flour, and mahleb. Use a wooden spoon to incorporate the dry ingredients. The dough will be crumbly at first, but when squeezed should hold together without cracking. If the dough seems too wet, add more cake flour 1 tablespoon at a time.
If the dough is dry and cracking, add orange juice, 1 tablespoon at a time. After each small addition, squeeze a walnut-sized piece of dough in your hand to test how it holds together (looking for pliable and soft).
Allow the dough to rest for about 15 minutes, then squeeze a palmful again and adjust as needed to form a soft, pliable dough, taking care not to overwork the dough with your hands.
For the filling, if using fresh dates, finely chop them by hand or in the food processor. In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the chopped dates with the butter,stirring until the dates are broken down to a paste. Cool.
Form this homemade or the premade date paste into small balls (coat your hands witha touch of oil or flour to prevent the date paste from sticking), using about1-1/2 teaspoons per ball. The size of your filling depends on the size of your cookie, so adjust as needed. This is for a 2-inch cookie mold.
Move the oven rack to the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper or Silpats.
Pull a piece of dough about the size of a walnut (1 ounce), shaping into a rough ball.
Coat the interior of a mold with flour, knocking out the excess. Don’t skip this step! Do it every time dough is pressed into the mold; it’s essential for releasing the molded dough. If the mold becomes caked with dough during the molding process, wipe it out with a towel or rinse and dry it.
Place a ball of dough into the mold. Press the dough ball into the mold, creating a hollow space in the center and pushing the dough up and over the perimeter edge. Fill the hollow with a date ball.
Cover the date ball with the dough, using a touch more dough as needed to seal the date ball inside the dough. Smooth the flat side of the dough numerous times with the tips and palm of the hand. Wipe the dough away from the cookie mold scallop edges so the base of the cookie will have precise lines.
Turn the mold over and decisively whack the top bottom-facing corner of the mold on the work surface to release the cookie. Better with one whack than two, to avoid mistakenly hitting the released cookie with the mold.
Transfer the ma'moul to the lined cookie sheet, spacing them about an inch apart.
Repeat this process with the rest of the dough and date filling, placing the cookies about an inch apart on the baking sheets.
Bake the cookies, one sheet pan at a time, for 15-17 minutes, or until the cookies are a very pale golden brown. Keep an eye on the cookies to monitor if they are beginning to crack at the top. If the tops begin to crack, immediately remove the cookies from the oven. Place the hot sheet pan on a cooling rack and leave the cookies undisturbed. Sift confectioners’ sugar over the cookies.",10,"▢ 8 oz. clarified butter, at solid cool room temperature",▢ 1 large egg yolk,▢ 1/4 cup or juice of 1/2 Navel orange,▢ 1 teaspoon orange blossom water,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 1 teaspoon whiskey,▢ 1/2 cup Confectioners sugar,Maureen Abood,https://maureenabood.com/sittos-date-mamoul/,▢ 2 teaspoons mahleb,▢ 4 1/2-5 cups cake flour,▢ 10 oz. date paste (also known as “baking dates”) OR 10 ounces fresh pitted dates plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or by hand with a wooden spoon, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, about two minutes on medium speed.
With the mixer off, scrape down the bowl. Add the eggs, orange blossom water, vanilla and anise extract and beat until it's well incorporated.
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, mahlab, anise, and nutmeg. With the mixer on low speed, add half of the flour mixture. Once moistened, add the remaining flour mixture and beat until combined. The dough should hold together when squeezed, without leaving dough on your fingers. Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed, to create a cohesive, but not dry, dough.
To shape the cookies with a mold. flour the mold well with flour, then knock of excess flour. Do this each time before pushing dough into the mold to ensure an easier release of the shaped dough.
Pull a large, 4 oz. piece of dough and shape it into a smooth ball. Flatten the dough to about a 3-inch disk on your work surface. Smooth any cracks in the dough. Gently lift the disk and press it into the floured mold. Evenly push the dough across the mold and shape the edges to prevent any cracking.
To remove the dough from the mold, gently loosen the dough around the perimeter of the mold, slowly working your way in as you loosen. Let gravity assist as you hold the mold face down and gently pull the shaped dough from the mold.
Repeat with all of the dough, placing the cookies on the prepared sheet pans about two inches apart, six cookies on one pan and four on the other.
Bake the cookies one sheet pan at a time, for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown throughout (not just at the perimeter). Remove from the oven and cool completely before glazing.
Make the glaze just before using it. In a medium bowl, combine the confectioner's sugar, corn syrup, orange blossom water, and 3 tablespoons water. Stir until the glaze falls in a very thick ribbon off of the spoon. Add drops of water if needed to get the correct consistency. Cover with plastic wrap until you're ready to use the glaze, stirring again to smooth it out.
Place the cookies on a rack with parchment underneath to catch drips. Spoon the glaze in the center of a cookie, and spread the glaze evently to the edges using the back of the spoon or a pastry brush. You'll get a feel for how thick you want the coating of glaze to be, making sure the cookie pattern shows through.
Allow the glazed cookies to harden over night. Store the cookies in an airtight container, in layers separated by waxed paper, for up to one week or longer. These are crunchy biscuit cookies so they last a good long time.",16,"▢ 1 1/2 cups (12 oz.) unsalted butter, softened",▢ 3/4 cup light brown sugar,▢ 3 teaspoons granulated sugar,▢ 2 large eggs,▢ 2 teaspoons orange blossom water,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 1 teaspoon anise extract,Maureen Abood,https://maureenabood.com/molded-shortbread-cookies/,"▢ 4 cups plus 2-3 tablespoons, unbleached, all-purpose flour, plus more to flour the molds",▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt,▢ 2 tablespoons mahleb,▢ 3 tablespoons ground anise,▢ 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg,▢ 3 cups confectioners' sugar,▢ 2 tablespoons corn syrup,▢ 2 teaspoons orange blossom water,▢ 4-5 tablespoons water
Frosted Cut-Out Cookies,Maureen Abood,NA,NA,Christmas,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,Website did not provide,3 dozen 3-inch cookies,10,"In a mixer, or by hand, beat the butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until very well combined and fluffy. This takes a few minutes so if you're not sure, keep going.
In a smaller bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the butter mixture and stir/mix until well-combined.
Lay two long sheets of plastic on the counter, overlapping eachother. Scrape the cookie dough onto the plastic and fold the plastic over the dough, shaping the dough into a 2-inch thick rectangle. This helps get the rolling started more easily with the chilled dough. Chill for at least one hour.
Make the buttercream. In a medium bowl, combine the very soft butter with the confectioners' sugar. This takes plenty of doing if stirring by hand. A rubber spatula works well. At first the mixture looks dry and as though it needs liquid. Add the vanilla and keep stirring. the butter. will hydrate the sugar and a smooth, thick mixture will form. The idea is to have a thick butter cream that will dry well on the cookies. If the frosting needs thinning, add a teaspoon of milk.
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line sheet pans with parchment paper. Line the counter with a silpat, or use a board covered with a thin bread towel (that's what Betty Crocker recommended). Or, just flour the counter well (this is not preferred, as you need a lot of flour to prevent the dough from sticking and the cookies don't taste as good with all that flour).
Work quickly through the rolling and cutting process to keep the dough cold. Remove the chilled dough from the plastic and cut it in half. Put one half back in the refrigerator. Place the other half on the silpat/board/counter and dust the dough and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Start the rolling by pounding the pin across the dough evenly. Then start rolling, moving the dough after every few rolls so that it won't stick to the work surface, adding more flour underneath as needed. Roll to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness.
Dip the cutters in flour. Like a puzzle, figure out the way to cut the dough so you get as many cuts as possible. Carefully transfer the cut-outs to the sheet pans. Repeat the rolling with the scraps, but don't knead the scraps together. A light touch combining the scraps will result in better, more tender second-rolled cookies. Just pat the pieces together and let the rolling pin combine as you roll.
Bake the cookies for about 8 minutes, or until light golden brown. Keep an eye on the cookies to determine how long they need in your oven.
Cool the cookies on racks. Place sheets of wax paper on the counter. Set out a plate to catch the sprinkles as you decorate the cookies. Use a small cheese knife to frost the cookies, and sprinkle them immediately after frosting them so that the sprinkles will stick. Let the cookies dry on the wax paper, then eat, and store extras in an airtight container. Separate layers of cookies in the container with wax paper to protect the frosting.

Line two sheet pans with parchment or a silpat.
Using a mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the butter on high speed until fluffy, creamy and pale, about six minutes. Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula for even whipping. Add the confectioners’ sugar, orange blossom water, and vanilla and whip until well combined and fluffy, another 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk the flour and salt. On low speed, slowly blend in the flour, ½ cup at a time.
Handle the dough as gingerly as possible to shape the cookies. Knead the dough just enough to form a cohesive dough. Take a large handful of the dough and shape it into a log about 1-inch tall and wide (this is pretty narrow!) on a lightly floured surface. If the dough is crumbly, gently push it together. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to square off the sides of the log, and to cut ½-inch pieces diagonally (these are quite small; they expand when baked).
Place the diamonds on a parchment-lined heavy sheet pan and bake until the cookies are baked through but still pale, about 18-20 minutes. The cookies should not be browned except for very minimally on the bottom.
Remove from the oven and cool on the sheet pan.
Gently melt the white chocolate chips with the coconut oil in a double boiler. White chocolate is very delicate takes this indirect heat to melt properly. Or, melt the chocolate with the coconut oil in 15 second increments in the microwave.
Pulverize the blueberries until they are finely ground. Sift in a fine mesh sieve. Do the same, in clean grinder or processor, with the strawberries.
Divide the melted white chocolate into three small bowls. Add a teaspoon or so of the blueberry powder to one bowl, and the strawberry powder to another bowl. Leave the third bowl of white chocolate as is. Stir the powder and chocolate well, adding more powder for more color and flavor as you like.
To dip the cooled cookies, dunk the top half of a cookie in one of the colored chocolates, taking care to coat the top only of the cookie for easier drying and handling of the cookie. Use a spoon to assist in coating part of the cookie. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off back into the bowl. Place the cookie back on the parchment lined cookie sheet and sprinkle with a bit of the pistachios. Dip all of the cookies in this way, with 1/3 of the cookies in the blueberry chocolate, 1/3 of the cookies in the strawberry chocolate, and 1/3 of the cookies in the plain white chocolate.

Add the yeast and stir to dissolve.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment, or by hand in a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, mahleb, anise, arak, nutmeg, sesame seeds, and salt. Slowly add the butter mixture and mix on low speed or by hand until a cohesive dough forms. Increase the speed on the mixer to knead the dough for five minutes, or by hand on the counter for 10 minutes, to form a smooth, soft dough.
Lightly oil a large bowl with the olive oil. Coat the dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap, then a clean kitchen towel. Set the dough in a warm spot to rise until at least doubled in size, which can take 2 to 3 hours.
To create a warm setting for the balls to rise again, place a kitchen or bread towel on the counter or on sheet pans and cover with wax paper, parchment, or plastic wrap. Divide the dough into 18 pieces by cutting or squeezing off balls about 3 oz each (2 ½ inches wide; the size can be larger or smaller, to your liking). Place the balls on the prepared area about 2 inches apart, and cover with another towel. Let the balls rise for 30 minutes.
Heat the oven to 325°F, with a rack in the center of the oven. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper and if you have more sheet pans, double the pans to prevent overbaking the bottom of the ka'ik. Dust the counter and molds lightly with flour, tapping out any excess flour from the mold.
Lightly coat a dough ball with flour, and flatten the dough into a flat circle. Press the dough into the mold with some force with your fingers and palm numerous times without lifting the dough from the mold. Push in the dough that falls over the edges as you go.
To unmold the dough, use gravity as your friend and turn the mold over. Gently peel the dough away from the edges and it will fall out into your hand. If using your hands to shape and design the top of thd dough, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand. Pinch the edges five or six times around the circle and poke with the tines of a fork over the top. Transfer the shaped dough with the design side facing up on the prepared sheet pan.
Repeat this process with the remaining dough, arranging the molded dough about 2 inches apart with six at per pan. Bake one sheet at a time, re-using the pans and parchment once they are finished.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer the ka'ak to cooling racks until cool.
Make the glaze while ka’ak bakes. Combine the confectioners' sugar with rose water, water, and corn syrup, stirring until the glaze falls in a ribbon off of the spoon. Add drops of water if needed to get the correct consistency. Cover with plastic wrap until you're ready to use the glaze, stirring again to smooth it out. Place parchment paper under cooling racks to catch glaze drips.
Dip the tops of the ka'ik in the glaze, letting the excess glaze run off of the ka'ik back into the bowl. Place the ka'ik on cooling racks and allow the glaze harden for at least one hour.

Enjoy the beauty. Add the vanilla, orange blossom water, and 3 tablespoons of the sugar and beat for another couple of minutes.
Sift in the flour and gently incorporate it into the butter with a wooden spoon. Add the milk, and then add more flour by the tablespoon until, as Sitto says, “the dough is ready to shape.” That means you should be able to make a ball that will flatten in your floured palm without melting into your hand or without cracking. Get your hands into the dough and knead it for a minute or two. Chill the dough for 30 minutes.
Make the filling by processing the nuts until they are nearly-finely ground. Don’t take them too far or they will become paste. The nuts can also be finely chopped by hand. In a small bowl, combine the nuts with 3 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon orange blossom water, using your fingers to evenly distribute everything.
Line two heavy baking sheets with parchment or Silpats. Pre-heat the oven to 325⁰F.
To form the ma’moul, I like to press a bit of the dough in to grease the mold, then flour the ma’moul mold generously so that all grooves are coated. Pinch off about a tablespoon, walnut-sized piece of the chilled dough (larger or smaller depending on the size of your mold. A few tries will tell you how much to use). Flour the palm of your hand to prevent the dough from sticking, and flatten the dough in your palm to make a small (about 2-inch) round. Place about a teaspoon of the walnut filling in the center of the dough, then fold it over like a crescent and seal the edges. Stretch the dough a little to get the dough over the nuts to seal.
Gently nestle the stuffed dough, seam-side up (facing you), into the mold cavity. Using a light touch, press the dough into the mold—it doesn’t take much for the dough to assume the form of the mold. Flatten the exposed dough and wipe away any access with your fingers, making sure that the edge of the molded shape is clear of dough, for a defined cookie edge. You will get a feel for how much dough your mold takes, and how much filling you need, as you make a few of the cookies.
Turn the mold over and slam it against the work surface until the cookie falls out. If you need to keep slamming to work out any stress in your life, have at it.
Repeat this process with the remaining dough and cookies, moving the cookies to the sheet pans. If the dome of your cookies doesn’t seem tall enough, plump them up by nudging the dough around the base of each cookie in a bit.
Bake one pan of cookies at a time, until they are still mostly white but golden on the bottom. Check them by lifting one with a flat metal spatula after 15 minutes, and then again every minute or so for about 20 minutes, depending on the size of your cookies.

To shape the cookies, pull off a heaping teaspoon of dough and roll it between the palms of your hand into a smooth ball. Smoothness is key here to avoiding cracks in the cookies when they’re baked.
