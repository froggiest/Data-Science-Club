Next, while holding the cookie by the sides, use your free hand to generously sprinkle the coconut over the top, allowing the excess to fall back into the bowl.

Mint Ganache Cookies,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 10 ,"Mint Ganache Cookies are not only beautiful and tinted pastel green, they are deliciously flavoured with mint and topped with a silky, smooth, creamy mint ganache.

Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper. Set that aside. 
In a mixing bowl, beat together the butter and the confectioner’s sugar for 2-3 minutes until creamy and smooth.  
Add the mint extract, both egg yolks, and the green food colouring. Beat until thoroughly blended.
Add the flour and the baking powder to the mixing bowl and beat until just incorporated. 
Portion the dough into one tablespoon amounts. Roll it into balls and set them two inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. 
Use a wooden mixing spoon to poke a deep hole into the center of each ball. Do not push the handle of the spoon all the way through!
Bake the cookies for 12 minutes. 
Remove them from the oven and use the wooden spoon once again to reshape the hole/well, if needed. 
Cool the cookies for three minutes and transfer to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
Once the cookies are completely cool, it’s time to prepare and apply the ganache topping. To do so, add the chocolate, cream, and butter, and mint extract to a microwave-safe bowl.  In 30 second increments on high speed, melt the ingredients together until smooth.  Be sure to stir well between each increment.  
Once the chocolate mixture is completely smooth, transfer the ganache to a Ziploc bag. 
Use scissors to cut a small tip from one lower corner of the bag.  Gently squeeze the chocolate mixture into the hold/well of each cookie. Because this ganache is not as firm as regular ganache, do not overfill the holes to prevent it from running over the side of the cookie. The chocolate mixture might seem thin, but it will firm up.  
Allow cookies to rest until ganache has set – about an hour or so.

To avoid things like fingerprints on the Peanut Butter Cups, or to keep them from melting too quickly when the come in contact with the heat from the cookies, it’s important to chill them first. So, to start, unwrap them and set them in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Place in fridge to chill for 20-30 minutes.
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Lightly grease two twelve-cavity muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. If you have only one muffin tin, you can bake these in batches.

Elf on the Shelf Cereal Cookies,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 8 ,"Elf on the Shelf Cereal Cookies are prepared with a delicious sugar cookie base which has finely crushed cereal incorporated into the batter.  Next, the cookies are glazed and topped with lots of broken cereal bits.  These cookies are super crunchy and super flavourful!",Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins, Cook Time 12 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 42 minutes mins,32 cookies,14,"You will need a half cup of cereal dust and two cups of cereal crumbs for this recipe. The easiest way to get both is with a food processor. Add three cups of cereal to your food processor and pop on the lid. Pulse just twice – two very short pulses! Transfer the cereal to a fine mesh colander with a large bowl underneath.
Tap the colander against the bowl, allowing the cereal dust to fall through. Essentially, you are separating the larger crumbs from the smaller, dust-like crumbs. Once done, you should have a half cup of dust, or at least very close to it. If you don’t have a full half cup, don’t worry about it. Whatever you do, do not exceed half cup. It will make the cookie dough too soft and it will spread very flat when baked.
Next, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside. 
In a large bowl, use a mixer to beat together the butter and sugar until creamy and light yellow in colour. (About 4-5 minutes.) 
Add the eggs one at a time and beat into the butter and sugar mixture. 
Finally, beat in the vanilla extract.
Next, add in the flour, salt, baking powder, and cereal dust. Beat into the wet mixture until well combined.

Once completely cooled, stir the milk into the confectioner’s sugar until a thin, smooth frosting is formed. 
Lay the cookies face up onto a wire cooling rack with a baking sheet underneath to catch any dripping frosting. 
You can use a fork to drizzle the frosting over the cookies, but I like to transfer the frosting to a small Ziploc bag and cut off a little bit of one of the lower corners of the bag. Then, working in a zigzag motion, drizzle the frosting over the cookies.

Use a rubber spatula to scrape the dough into a ball.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.  Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.  Set aside.  
Portion the dough into one-tablespoon amounts.  
Roll the dough into balls and set the balls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.   
Use a small water glass to gently press the balls flat to about just over ¼ inch thick. (If the glass sticks to the dough, dip the bottom of the glass into plain flour and gently tap off the excess. Depending on how warm your kitchen might be, you may need to do this to flatten each cookie.)
Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are lightly browned on the outer edges.  
Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for 1 minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling completely.
Once the cookies are completely cool, it’s time to prepare and apply the ganache topping.

Gently squeeze the chocolate mixture onto each cookie to form a dollop right in the center. The chocolate mixture might seem thin, but it will harden.  
Once done, you can use the fat end of a chopstick or the handle of a wooden mixing spoon to push down any peaks in the ganache.

It’s best to stick to a piping bag.
Pipe a dollop of frosting onto the bottom of one cookie. You can really use a little or as much as you want. I found that about two teaspoons of frosting were perfect. (If you don’t have a piping bag, you can spread the frosting on in an even layer with a butter knife or an offset spatula.)

Marble Sugar Cookie Bars,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 8 ,"These pillow-soft, beautifully festive red and green Marble Sugar Cookie Bars are going to be on everyone's wishlist this Christmas! The cookie base is buttery and sweet with a light fruity note and topped with a homemade buttercream frosting. One should not question if they will make these; only question whether you will call them bars, squares, cookies, or even cake!",Recipes,Prep Time 10 minutes mins, Cook Time 25 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 35 minutes mins,24 bars,15,"Begin by preheating your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 9×13 baking pan with parchment paper. Fold the parchment paper so that it fits snugly in the pan. I use two sheets – one folded to fit the length of the pan and another folded to fit across the pan. Allow the excess parchment paper to hang out over the side of the pan. Once the confection is firm, use the excess parchment to lift the whole block out of the pan to make it easy to cut into squares.
Next, add the softened butter and sugar to a large mixing bowl. Beat until creamy and well combined. 
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
Next, beat in the almond extract. 
Finally, add the flour and baking soda. Beat until just incorporated. 
Now, divide the dough in half and transfer one half to a separate mixing bowl. Add 8-10 drops of green food colouring to one bowl and 8-10 drops of red to the second bowl of cookie dough. Beat the food colouring into the dough until just mixed, being sure to wipe the beaters clean after you have finished with the first colour. We don’t want any mixing of the colours at this point!
Using a small spring-action cookie scoop, scoop alternating spoonfuls of the red and green dough into the prepared baking dish in a random pattern. Try to cover the bottom of the pan. Once all of the dough has been randomly transferred to the pan, set aside the cookie scoop and use your hands to press the cookie dough flat into the pan. Really get in there so that there are no air pockets or gaps between the scooped cookie dough portions.
Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the bars comes out clean. Once done, remove the baking pan from the oven and allow the bars to fully cool before frosting them with the buttercream frosting.
To make the frosting, beat the butter (or vegetable shortening) in a large mixing bowl. 
Add the confectioner’s sugar one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. 
Next, beat in the vanilla extract and milk. 
Once the sugar cookie base is fully cooled, you can frost it. If you want to remove the base from the pan before frosting, lift it straight up and out using the excess parchment paper you left draped over the sides when preparing the pan for baking. If you prefer, you can leave the sugar cookie base in the pan and frost it as is. Lifting it out makes it easier to slice it into squares.
Make sure your frosting is at room temperature. Smear the frosting evenly onto the sugar cookie base. Once the frosting is applied, add the sprinkles. 
You can now slice the bars, but if you want a cleaner, professional-looking slice, place the entire baking pan in the fridge for 30-40 minutes. This will firm up the frosting which will allow you to cut through the frosting and the bar without too much smearing or smudging.

To make the edible blood, measure all of the ingredients into a bowl and whisk until very well combined. Whisk slowly! If you whisk vigorously, you will incorporate air bubbles into the blood. Try to avoid that.
Use a thin wire whisk to dip into the edible blood and drizzle it over the cookies in a gently swishing motion.

Patriotic Glazed Shortbread Cookies,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,4.48, 23 ,"A classic, old-fashioned shortbread recipe is the basis of this festively decorated and garnished, beautiful Patriotic Glazed Shortbread Cookies. These are gorgeous and look super appealing. They make a great gift idea too! The light, buttery, crisp cookie stands up well to the shiny, sugary icing!",Recipes,Prep Time 20 minutes mins, Cook Time 15 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 35 minutes mins,36 cookies,13,"In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and the sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy.
Add the vanilla and incorporate into the butter and sugar mixture.
Add the flour and cornstarch.  On low speed, mix into the butter and sugar until well incorporated.
Divide the dough into two portions, wrap each portion completely in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for 2 hours.
When ready to bake, remove dough from fridge and let sit at room temperature for a few minutes.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or a silicone liner.  Set aside.
Roll one portion of the dough to 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface.  Use a star shape, or your favourite cookie cutter shape to cut out the cookies.  Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches of space between each cookie.
Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and let sit for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
Once the cookie is completely cooled, whisk together the icing ingredients and set aside.
Line the cookies up on the cooling rack so that they are evenly spaced.  Place a layer of paper towels under the cooling rack for easy clean up.  (This will catch the icing if any drips over the side.)
Dip each cookie, top side down, into the icing.  Do not submerge the cookie.  Just dip the surface.  Gently shake off the excess and place the cookie, icing side up, back onto the cooling rack.
Top the cookie with sprinkles and move on to the next cookie until all cookies have been iced and sprinkled.
Allow the iced cookies to sit undisturbed for one hour.  This will allow the icing to harden.
Cookies can be stacked.  Store in a food-safe container.  Can be frozen up to 3 months.   ",10,"2 cups butter, softened",1 cup confectioner’s sugar,2 teaspoons vanilla extract,1/2 cup cornstarch,3 cups all purpose flour,2 cups confectioner’s sugar,3 tablespoons milk,3 tablespoons corn syrup,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"1 cup sprinkles, your choice of theme",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/patriotic-glazed-shortbread-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Divide the dough into two portions, wrap each portion completely in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for 2 hours.
When ready to bake, remove dough from fridge and let sit at room temperature for a few minutes.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or a silicone liner.  Set aside.
Roll one portion of the dough to 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface.  Use an ornament shape, or your favourite cookie cutter shape to cut out the cookies.  If making ornaments, punch a hole in the top of the cookie with a small straw.  Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches of space between each cookie.

Once the cookie is completely cooled, whisk together the icing ingredients and set aside.
Line the cookies up on the cooling rack so that they are evenly spaced.  Place a layer of paper towels under the cooling rack for easy clean up.  (This will catch the icing if any drips over the side.)
At this point, you have two decorating options.  A.) Dip each cookie, top side down, into the icing.  Do not submerge the cookie.  Just dip the surface.  Gently shake off the excess and place the cookie, icing side up, back onto the cooling rack.  Top with sprinkles.  B.) Place the un-iced cookies onto a wire cooling rack.  Transfer the icing to a Ziploc bag and cut off a small tip in the lower corner.  Drizzle the icing back and forth over the cookie to create a zigzag shape.  Top with sprinkles.
Allow the iced cookies to sit undisturbed for one hour.  This will allow the icing to harden.
Cookies can be stacked.  Store in a food-safe container.  Can be frozen up to 3 months.   ",10,"2 cups butter, softened",1 cup confectioner’s sugar,2 teaspoons vanilla extract,1/2 cup cornstarch,3 cups all purpose flour,2 cups confectioner’s sugar,3 tablespoons milk,3 tablespoons corn syrup,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"1 cup sprinkles, Christmas themed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/christmas-tree-ornament-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a mixing bowl, beat together the peanut butter and butter until well combined.
Add the vanilla extract and beat to incorporate.
Next, beat in the confectioner's sugar one cup at a time.  The dough should be slightly crumbly.  If you notice that it's getting too crumbly before the last confectioner's sugar is combined, hold back and add 1/4 cup at a time.  Depending on the consistency of your peanut butter and how packed the confectioner's sugar might be, your dough could take more or less of it.  Likewise, if the dough is too wet after the addition of the 3rd cup, add 1/4 cup more at a time until the dough is slightly crumbly.
Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and really press it in.  It's a good idea to use a small rolling pin or even a drinking glass to firmly roll the dough out into the pan to get it flat and even.  Set aside.
Next, measure semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl along with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil.
In increments of 30 seconds at half power, melt the chocolate, stirring well between each increment. Once the chocolate is fully melted and silky smooth, pour it over the peanut butter layer and smooth it out with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon.

Strawberry Shortcake Drumsticks,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,NA,NA,"When it comes to serving up a scoop of ice cream at home, nothing beats doing so in one of these delicious drumstick sugar cones.

If using short drinking glasses to keep the cones standing up, place 6 drinking glasses onto a platter or baking tray.  This will make it easy to transport to the fridge.
Add the white chocolate chips and vegetable oil to a microwave-safe bowl.  On 50% power, and in 30-second increments, melt the chocolate until smooth.
Working with one cone at a time, hold the cone upright and spoon a couple of tablespoons of the melted chocolate into the cavity of the cone. Turn the cone slowly, allowing the chocolate to cover the entire interior surface of the cone. Turn the cone upside down and allow the excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl.
Next, holding the bottom of the cone, dip the top portion straight down into the bowl of chocolate. Very gently shake the cone in an up and down fashion. This will force the excess chocolate to drip off and back into the bowl.
Next, hold the cone over the bowl of strawberry shortcake crumbs. Use a spoon to spoon the crumbs over the still wet, melted chocolate. Turn the cone, spooning more crumbs over it, until the dipped portion of the cone is covered in crumbs. Place the cone in an upright position in a drinking glass or an ice cream cone stand.
Repeat until all of the cones are prepared. Transfer the cones to your fridge for 30  minutes to harden.  Save the remaining chocolate!
Once hard, re-melt the remaining chocolate in the same fashion as before and transfer the melted, smooth chocolate to a sandwich bag, cutting a small tip from one of the lower corners.
Again, working with one cone at a time, hold the bottom of the cone and drizzle the melted chocolate over the top half of the cone, drizzling from side to side while turning the cone in your hand.  Place the cone back into the drinking glass or ice cream cone stand.  Once all of the cones are complete, refrigerate the cones once again for another 30 minutes.

Now you can coat the waffle irons. DO NOT use butter! Use a non-stick cooking spray. Butter will burn and some of the water content will evaporate after each use, so by waffle number three, there is bound to be sticking. Avoid sticking by using non-stick cooking spray!
Depending on the size of your waffle maker, scoop out the desired amount of waffle batter and position it right onto the center of the bottom iron. (I’m using 1/2 cup of batter for each waffle.)

Divide the dough in half and form each half into a disk measuring an inch thick. Wrap each disk in a sheet of plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
In the meantime, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and prepare a baking sheet by lining it with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Set aside.
Working with one disk of dough at a time, roll it to 1/4 inch thick between two sheets of parchment paper. Using parchment paper eliminates the need to dust the rolling surface or rolling pin with flour, which will ensure a dark, chocolatey cookie.
Dust the cookie stamp by pressing the stamp end gently into a bowl of flour. Tap the stamp firmly on the edge of the bowl to get rid of the excess flour. Holding the stamp as straight as possible, press the stamp into the dough just slightly to make the indent. (This might take a time or two to practice how hard you need to press to get a deep enough indent.)
Next, set the stamp aside, and use a snowflake-shaped cookie cutter to cut around the stamped dough.

Remove the cookies from the oven promptly and allow the cookies to rest for 2 minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.

Add in the lemon juice, lemon extract, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.  Beat until combined. 
In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks are formed.

To assemble, dip lady fingers into the limoncello – quickly in and out – do not soak!  Set the dipped ladyfingers into a single layer in the bottom of your trifle bowl or serving dish.  At any time you may cut the ladyfingers to fit into spaces while layering. A serrated knife works very well to cut ladyfingers without breaking them. Use a light back-and-forth sawing motion for best results.
Top the first layer of ladyfingers with a cup of the mascarpone mixture. Smooth it out to a flat layer. 
Next, dip one ladyfinger at a time into the limoncello and place it against the side of your trifle bowl, pushing the bottom end gently into the layer of mascarpone to help the ladyfinger stand. Work your way around the bowl until you have covered the perimeter with ladyfingers.
Push a layer of ladyfingers onto the still-exposed mascarpone layer at the bottom of the bowl. 
Top that with one-third of the remaining mascarpone mixture. 
Add another layer of ladyfingers and top that with another third of the mascarpone.

Instant Pot Korean Beef Ribs,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 12 ,"Instant Pot Korean Beef Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender! This super quick and easy recipe packs a punch of robust and savoury flavours.  Prepared with gochujang and honey, these ribs are both a little spicy and sweet.  As an added bonus, the cooking liquid doubles as a thick, delicious sauce!",Recipes,Prep Time 20 minutes mins, Cook Time 1 hour hr,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr 20 minutes mins,4 servings,7,"Prepare the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, broth, gochujang, sugar, jelly, vinegar, honey, ketchup, and salt. Set aside.
Season both sides of the ribs with salt and pepper. With your instant pot set to the saute function, add the olive oil and once hot, sear the beef ribs for 4-5 minutes per side just to brown them.  Don’t overcrowd your instant pot.  This will need to be done in batches.  Once done, remove the beef ribs and set them aside on a plate.
Once all of the ribs have been seared, carefully drain the grease out of the pot. The pot does not need to be completely void of grease. Also, don’t wipe it out! Save the remaining grease to cook the garlic.
Next, add the garlic and ginger to the instant pot and cook for 1-2 minutes.  Immediately add the sauce mixture.  Stir well, being sure to push the spoon against the bottom of the instant pot to release any stuck-on bits.
Add the beef ribs back to the instant pot; try to submerge them in the liquid as much as possible.  Cook the beef ribs on high for 50 minutes.  
Naturally release the steam for 10 minutes and use the quick release to get rid of any remaining pressure. The beef ribs are ready to enjoy and so is the sauce.  If you’d like a thicker sauce, remove the ribs and set them aside. 
Switch the setting on the instant pot to saute and allow the liquid to come to a boil.  In the meantime, whisk one tablespoon of cornstarch with one tablespoon of water.  Once the liquid is boiling, add the cornstarch mixture while whisking.  The sauce will thicken as it continues to boil.  Once thickened to your liking, turn off the instant pot and transfer the sauce to a serving bowl.",15,4 pounds beef short ribs (Do not use Asian-style short ribs for this recipe.

The first step is to make the strawberry shortcake crumbs. While the baked portion of the crumbs cools, you can prepare the other parts of this recipe so that all that is needed is some assembly.
Add the white chocolate chips to a microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on medium power for 30 seconds. Remove from the microwave and stir well with a rubber spatula. Microwave again for 30 seconds on medium power and stir well. Repeat this until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
Using a silicone pastry brush, brush the melted chocolate onto the entire outer surface of a waffle bowl.  Immediately roll the chocolate-covered portion of the waffle bowl into the strawberry shortcake crumbs until well coated.  Continue to do this until all 4 waffle bowls are covered.  Set them aside for 2 hours for the chocolate to firm up or pop them in your fridge for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Add the confectioner’s sugar, one cup at a time, and beat well into the cream cheese.  Next, add two tablespoons of heavy cream and ¼ cup of sour cream.  Beat into the cream cheese mixture until well combined.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
To assemble, transfer the cream cheese mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large piping tip.  This will make it easier to get the cream cheese mixture into the waffle cups.  Of course, you can always spoon it in and smooth it out with the back of a spoon too.  Layer the bottom of each waffle bowl with 1/8th of the cream cheese mixture.
Top that layer with fresh strawberries.  Pipe a large rosette shape onto the strawberry layer and into the center of each waffle bowl.  If you are not using a piping bag, you can dollop with a spoon or use a cookie scoop to mound the cream cheese mixture.

If you are using fresh rhubarb, go ahead and add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan with the rhubarb now. Add in the lemon juice and the sugar. Over medium heat, cook the mixture, stirring often, until the rhubarb breaks down and a thick mixture remains. This will take about 20-30 minutes, depending on how much water content is in your rhubarb and how thick you want the compote to be.
The desired thickness level will vary. You will want to be able to spoon it up so that it remains slightly rounded on the spoon. Since rhubarb is fibrous, the compote will have a noticeable stringy look and texture. If you don’t care for that, you can cut the rhubarb into smaller pieces before preparing the compote. Once the compote is thick, remove it from the heat and allow it to fully cool.
While the prepared compote cools, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F, and add the crumb mixture ingredients to a mixing bowl. You can use your hands to massage the ingredients together or you can beat them together with a stand mixer or a hand-held mixer. 
Once the crumb mixture is well combined, transfer just over half of it to a 9×13-inch baking pan that has been lined with parchment paper. Press the crumb mixture down slightly to form a flat crust. You can use a drinking glass or a small rolling pin to roll out the crumb mixture evenly. 
Next, spoon the cooled compote mixture over the flattened crumb layer. 
Top that with the remaining crumb mixture, but rather than pushing it down to make it flat, crumble it over the rhubarb layer and let it fall where it may.

Prepare a bundt pan by coating the inside well with non-stick cooking spray and set it aside. 
In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy. 
Beat in the eggs one at a time until they are fully incorporated. 
Next, beat in the vanilla extract and buttermilk until just mixed through.
Now, add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground nutmeg and ground cinnamon. Beat until just incorporated. Do not over-mix the batter. 
Transfer the batter to the prepared bundt pan and smooth out the top. Tap the pan firmly a few times onto a cutting board and place it in the oven.
Bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the bundt pan for 20 minutes. Turn out onto a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
In a mixing bowl, beat together the butter and the cream cheese until light and fluffy. 
Add the confectioner’s sugar one cup at a time, fully incorporating it into the butter mixture after each addition. 
Next, add the buttermilk and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.  
Transfer the frosting mixture to a resealable bag or a piping bag. If using a resealable bag, cut the tip from one of the lower corners and make long sweeping motions over the cake, creating thick lines over the top, allowing the frosting to swoop down the side and into the middle of the bundt shape as well.
Next, fill the center hole of the bundt with a mixture of crushed and whole Easter-themed, candy-coated chocolate – much like Cadbury Mini Eggs or Easter M&Ms.

Easter Mini Egg Cake Pops,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 14 ,"Prepared with a homemade chocolate mini egg cake center, dipped in spring-like, pastel-coloured candy melts, and drizzled with melted white chocolate, Easter Mini Egg Cake Pops are fun to make and are super fun to eat too!  So much cheaper than store-bought cake pops, these are almost too delicious to share!",Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins, Cook Time 30 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 3 hours hrs,36 cake pops,25,"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
In a bowl, beat together the butter and the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy – about 3-5 minutes. 
Add the eggs, one a time, beating well after each addition. 
Add the vanilla extract and beat to incorporate.
Next, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the dry ingredients into the butter and sugar mixture until well combined. The mixture will be very thick! 
Add the milk and mix into the flour mixture. The milk will lighten up the batter.
Next, fold in the crushed mini eggs.
Pour the batter into a nine inch round pan that has been greased and floured. Tap the cake pan firmly on your countertop to flatten the cake batter into the pan. 
Bake for 30 minutes. 
Test to see if the cake is fully baked by inserting a toothpick into the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is ready. If not, bake for another 3-5 minutes and test again.
Remove cake from the oven and allow to cool in the cake pan for fifteen minutes. 
Remove from the cake pan and allow cake to finish cooling on a wire cooling rack. 
In a bowl, beat together the butter and the cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add the confectioner’s sugar and fully incorporate it into the butter mixture. Next, add the buttermilk and vanilla extract. Beat until combined. Set aside.
When the cake is completely cooled, break it into pieces and transfer it to a bowl. Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer, beat on low speed until the cake is crumbly. Add the binding cream and beat on low just to incorporate.
Working with a slightly heaping tablespoon of the cake mixture, roll it into a ball and slightly press one end to form an egg shape. Place the egg-shaped balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all of the cake mixture has been rolled, place the baking sheet in your fridge for 30 minutes to set.
While the cake balls are chilling, prepare a workstation to make the decorating process quick, easy, and painless. Here’s how I do it! Portion each colour of candy melts into separate bowls. Try to use bowls that are not too big. A small, deep bowl is best because you’ll be able to easily dunk the cake balls into the melted candy melts. I use ramekins for this process. I used 3/4 cup of candy melts for each colour. With 5 colours, I used almost 4 cups of candy melts. You won’t use all of that up, but you need enough to dip the balls into.
The next thing you will need is white chocolate chips and lollipop sticks. Melt the white chocolate chips in the microwave in 30-second increments on half power. Stir between each increment until the white chocolate is melted and smooth. Set that aside for now.
Next, prepare your egg cartons. It might sound odd, but it’s important to stand the cake pops up to dry once they are dipped. Turn the egg cartons upside down and use a metal skewer or the thin end of a chopstick to poke a hole into each cavity. Don’t make the hole too big! It needs to be snug so that the cake pop doesn’t fall over! It’s also a good idea to weigh the egg cartons. I loaded mine up with silverware and bound the cartons with elastic bands before turning them over to poke the holes in them. By now, the cake balls will be chilled enough to get going!
Dip one of the lollipop sticks about a half inch into the melted white chocolate chips. Holding one of the egg-shaped, chilled cake balls in your hand, gently, but firmly push the white chocolate-dipped end of the lollipop stick into the bottom of the cake ball. Try to keep the stick straight and push it until it reaches about half of the length of the cake ball.
Place the ball back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Continue to do this until all of the cake balls have been paired with a lollipop stick. Next, get them back into the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up that melted white chocolate. Now that the balls are stuck to the stick, there will be no risk of them dropping off when you dunk them into the melted candy melts! Save the remaining white chocolate! We will re-melt that and use it for drizzling once the cake pops are coated.
Because melted candy melts can firm up quickly, it is important to melt one colour at a time. Melt them in a microwave at half power for 30 seconds. Stir and repeat until the candy melts are smooth and silky. Fetch the chilled cake balls from the fridge and working with one at a time, dip the cake ball into the candy melts. Tap the lollipop stick on the edge of the bowl, allowing the excess candy melts to drip back into the bowl.
Transfer the coated cake ball to one of the prepared holes in the egg carton. Move on to the next cake ball and continue this process until the desired number of cake balls have been coated. Once you have coated them, melt the next colour of candy melts and coat more cake balls. Once all of the cake balls are coated, set the egg cartons aside and let the candy melts harden. This should take about 90 minutes, depending on how warm your kitchen might be.
Once the candy melts have hardened, it’s time to add the white chocolate drizzle. Place the previously melted, leftover white chocolate into the microwave. Following the same microwave melting technique as before, melt the chips until smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate chips to a resealable sandwich bag and cut a very small tip from one lower corner.
Working with one cake pop at a time, pick it up by the stick and hold the cake pop horizontally over your sink. While you gently and carefully twirl the cake pop, drizzle the melted white chocolate out of the sandwich bag and over the pop to make very fine white lines in a random streaking pattern. Once done, return the cake pop to its home in the egg carton and move on to the next.
Once all of the cake pops are coated, allow them to sit until the white chocolate is firm to the touch. Next, package each pop into a cellophane package and tie the bottom with a string or ribbon. Store them at room temperature for 2-3 days or freeze them for up to 3 months.",16,"1/2 cup butter, softened",1 cup sugar,2 large eggs,2 teaspoons vanilla extract,1 3/4 cups all purpose flour,2 teaspoons baking powder,1/2 teaspoon salt,1/2 cup milk,"1 cup Cadbury Mini Eggs, slightly crushed","2 ounces cream cheese, brick-style","2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",1 cup confectioner's sugar,1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract,1 tablespoon buttermilk,"4 cups candy melts, various colours",1 cup white chocolate chips,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/easter-mini-egg-cake-pops/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With your instant pot set to the saute function, add the olive oil and once hot, sear the beef ribs for 4-5 minutes per side just to brown them.  Don’t overcrowd your instant pot.  This will need to be done in batches.  Once done, remove the beef ribs and set them aside on a plate.
Next, add the garlic to the instant pot and cook for 1-2 minutes.  
Immediately add the beef broth, low sodium soy sauce, and tomato paste.  Stir being sure to push the spoon against the bottom of the instant pot to release any stuck on bits.

Cook the beef ribs on high for 50 minutes.  
Naturally release the steam for 10 minutes and use the quick release to get rid of any remaining pressure.

This will level out the spoon so that the melted chocolate will not spill out. To keep the spoons from moving about too much, line the baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Place the prepared baking sheet, complete with the tablespoons, in your freezer to chill. A cold baking sheet and spoons will prevent the melted chocolate from spreading out too much.
Place the milk chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power in 30-second intervals, stirring well with a rubber spatula between each interval until the chocolate is creamy and smooth.
Remove the baking sheet with the spoons from the freezer and working with one spoon at a time, dip it into the melted chocolate. Be sure to fully submerge and coat the spoon well on both sides. Drip off the excess chocolate back into the bowl and set the spoon back onto the baking sheet, being sure to keep the handle of the spoon raised on the rim as before.
Once all of the spoons have been dipped into the melted chocolate, it’s time to fill the spoons. Using a teaspoon, fill each tablespoon with the remaining chocolate. Don’t overfill them; you don’t want the chocolate to run over the sides. Keep them neat and tidy. 
Once the spoons are filled, immediately sprinkle over the marshmallow bits, crushed cookies, and crumbled graham crackers. Set aside to set.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. 
Once chilled, remove the mixture from your fridge and roll it into one-inch balls. Place the balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 60 minutes.
Add the candy melts (or chocolate chips) to a microwave safe bowl. Add in one and a half teaspoons of vegetable shortening (only one teaspoon if you’re using chocolate chips) and microwave on medium speed for 30 seconds. Remove the candy melts from the microwave and stir well with a rubber spatula. Microwave again for 30 seconds on half speed and stir well. Repeat this until the candy melts are melted and smooth.
Working with chilled balls, insert a toothpick about 1/3rd of an inch into a ball. Dunk the ball into the bowl of melted candy melts and gently move the toothpick in a circular motion so that the entire ball is enrobed. Carefully lift the ball out of the bowl and lightly tap the toothpick on the rim. The excess candy melts will fall back into the bowl.
With a second toothpick, run it very gently under the ball to wipe away the excess candy melts. Do not press the toothpick against the ball; just wipe it against the dripping chocolate.
Next, transfer the ball to the prepared baking tray. Using the second toothpick, push it gently into the hole where the first toothpick is standing. Gently twist the first toothpick between your thumb and finger to loosen. Pull the toothpick up and out.

No baking is required; all you need to do is melt the chocolate and you're ready to go!",Recipes,Prep Time 20 minutes mins,NA,NA,Total Time 20 minutes mins,12 pops,8,"Begin by carefully separating the double stuffed Oreos.  It is imperative that all the cream is left intact on one of the cookies, while the other is clean-ish.  An easy way to do this is to stand the Oreo on its end and gently run a sharp knife down the inside of one side.  Lay the side with all of the filling on it onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  The non-filling side can be put aside for snacking later.
Repeat the same process with the mini Oreos.  This time, you will need to reserve all 24 of the non-filling side, and 12 of the filling side. 
To assemble, lay one of the double stuffed Oreos onto a cutting board, filling side up.  Use two of the mini Oreos for the ears.  For the ears, use the mini Oreos with no cream filling on them.  With the printed side up, gently push them into the filling on the double stuffed Oreo.  About two thirds of the mini Oreo should be sticking out over the top, while the bottom third should be sticking to the filling.
Next, place a lollipop stick onto the bottom half of the Oreo.  The top of the stick should be set in the center, but at the bottom, of the two Oreo ears. Now, place another double stuffed Oreo, filling side down, onto the partially assembled Oreo.  Gently push to ensure the cream adheres well, affixing the ears and the lollipop stick. 
Take one of the mini Oreos with the filling on it, and set it filling side down onto the Oreo lollipop.  It should be placed just slightly above the bottom of the larger Oreo.  Gently push to stick.  This will be the nose of the polar bear.  Set aside and continue until all of the lollipops are assembled.
Place the white chocolate chips and vegetable shortening into a microwave-safe bowl. Whenever you microwave chocolate, you should microwave on medium power for 30 seconds. Then, if it’s still not silky smooth, microwave in increments of 5 or 10 seconds, depending on your microwave, stirring with a rubber spatula after each increment.
Once the chocolate is melted and smooth, dip one assembled Polar Bear at a time all the way down into the melted chocolate until the cookie portion is completely covered.  Gently shake off the excess chocolate and transfer the lollipop to the prepared parchment-lined baking sheet so that the nose of the polar bear is facing up.

Allow the excess parchment paper to hang out over the side of the pan. Once the confection is firm, use the excess parchment to lift the whole block out of the pan to make it easy to cut into bars.
Next, add the butter, Nutella, and two tablespoons of water to a microwave-safe mixing bowl. You might not need to microwave anything at all, but it’s best to start in a microwave-safe bowl just in case. Use a sturdy spatula to mix the softened butter and Nutella until well combined. 
Next, add the confectioner’s sugar and stir to combine. No white residue from the confectioner’s sugar should be visible!
This is where the microwave-safe bowl comes in – if you find that it’s hard to stir the sugar into the Nutella and butter mixture, you can microwave it just a bit to soften it slightly. You don’t want a runny Nutella mess, but a quick 10 or 15-second zap in the microwave will make stirring much easier. If you feel that you can stir it well without using the microwave, please do so! Continue to stir until the mixture is completely smooth.
Now, add in the crushed pretzels, reserving two tablespoons for sprinkling on top later. Once again, use a sturdy spatula to stir all of the pretzels into the chocolate mixture. Make sure that everything is well combined! 
Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.  Press down with the spatula to flatten slightly.  Set aside while you melt the chocolate for the topping.
Remove the Mirage Chocolate Bars, or any alternative that you might be using, from the packaging. Break them up into smaller pieces.

If the chocolate is not silky smooth, reheat in increments of 5 or 10 seconds, depending on your microwave, stirring with a rubber spatula after each increment.
Once the chocolate is smooth, pour it over the layer of Nutella and pretzels. Use an offset spatula to smooth the chocolate. Top with the remaining two tablespoons of crushed pretzels and set the pan aside.

Spiced Christmas Jam,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,4.99, 122 ,"Cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves come together to create a warm and cozy holiday flavour in this Spiced Christmas Jam recipe.

It doesn’t matter if the berries are frozen or fresh, just puree them either way. Depending on the size of your food processor, you may have to do this in batches. Transfer all of the pureed strawberries and cranberries to a large saucepan. 
Measure the sugar and spices and add those to the saucepan now as well.
Over medium-high heat, bring the mixture to a full boil. 
Once fully boiling, meaning that even while stirring, the bubbles are still forming on top of the jam, continue to boil for one full minute. 
Remove the saucepan from the heat source and add in the liquid fruit pectin. Stir well to combine and place the saucepan back on the heat. 
Once the jam returns to a full boil, boil for one full minute, stirring the whole time. Remove from the heat. 
The bubbling will settle and once it does, use a spoon or ladle to skim off any foam and discard it.
Next, ladle the hot jam into the hot jars being sure to leave 1/4 inch of headspace. Place a clean, warm, sterilized seal on the jars and screw on a band until just finger-snug. That means that you should not apply any pressure when applying the screw band – just a snug fit is fine. 
Lower the jars into the canning jar. Be sure the water level covers the jars by two inches. Bring the water to a boil, cover the canning pot, and boil for 10 minutes. 
Once done, remove the jars from the water and transfer to a heat-proof surface. Allow jam to cool and set, undisturbed, for 12 hours. Wipe jars and label accordingly.

Holiday Vegetable Wreath,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 11 ,"Every party needs a platter or two of finger foods for everyone to munch on. No matter what type of party you're hosting, it most certainly needs a Holiday Vegetable Wreath platter. This gorgeous wreath is prepared using fresh broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, cucumbers, and more! Serve with your favourite vegetable dip!",Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins,NA,NA,Total Time 30 minutes mins,18 servings,9,"The first thing you want to do is to source a board. The number of people you are serving and the number of items you have to place on the board will help to determine the size you will need. You can use a cutting board, a charcuterie board, or even a large marble slab.
Before you begin, place the bowl you’ll be using for the dip right in the middle. You don’t need to fill it with dip just yet. Use the empty bowl as the center of the wreath and build around it.
Working with the broccoli first, build around the bowl, creating what you might call the template of the wreath. Not every space or gap needs to be filled in with the broccoli. Just be sure to place each piece of broccoli meticulously down so that the best side is up. Sometimes, broccoli can have lighter green or yellow sections. Just hide those by pointing them downward, if possible.
Next, go around the board with the cauliflower florets. Fill in some of the gaps if there are any. If there are no gaps, you can start to build onto the broccoli to create height.
Add pops of colour with orange and red cherry or grape tomatoes. 
Slice the cucumber and use a small star-shaped cookie cutter to cut stars from some of the cucumber slices.  Tuck in the sliced cucumbers and dot the top of the wreath with the cucumber stars. 
Cut the yellow bell pepper into large pieces. Lay the pieces flat on a cutting board and use a large star-shaped cookie cutter to cut out star shapes.  Lay the stars onto the wreat. 
Lastly, tuck in your sage leaves and sprigs of fresh thyme.

Add in the sour cream and beat into the cream cheese until well combined. 
Half the mixture. Set one half aside.
To the other half, add the chopped roasted red peppers, chopped marinated artichokes, salt, and black pepper. Beat well until combined. 
Spread a thin layer of the mixture onto the light rye bread, or the bread of your choosing. 
Top it with a second slice and press down gently to bind. 
Use a Christmas-themed cookie cutter to cut out your desired shape. 
Set the sandwich aside and make the next. Continue until you have used up the red pepper and artichoke mixture.
Using the cream cheese and sour cream mixture you had previously set aside, spread one slice of white bread with it. 
Sprinkle the middle of the sliced bread with nonpareils. 
Lay the second slice flat on a cutting board and use a small cookie cutter to cut a small star shape out of the bread. Save those little stars! 
Place the slice onto the prepared slice and press gently to create a bind. Use a cookie cutter to cut out the desired shape. Keep in mind that this shape should be much larger than the star shape in the middle.
Continue until you have used up the cream cheese mixture.
There is no preparation needed for the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. Smear one slice of bread with peanut butter and the other with jelly. 
Press the two together and cut out a shape with your cookie cutter of choice. 
To prepare the Ham and Cheese sandwiches, lightly spread mayo onto two slices of bread. 
Place a slice of ham onto one slice, followed by a slice of cheese, and the second slice of ham. 
Top with the remaining slice of bread and cut out your favourite shape.
Next, using fresh sprigs of edible greenery, such as summer savoury or kale, create a circular pattern on the board. I used cedar branches that I cut from one of our cedar trees. They were washed very well and dried in a salad spinner. Whatever greenery you choose to use, position the sprigs so that the leafy end is pointing out from the center of the board. The wreath size will be determined by how many sandwiches you will be piling onto it, so size the wreath accordingly. It’s always best to make the wreath a little bigger so that the green leaves are not completely covered with the sandwiches. 
Working with one sandwich at a time, lay the sandwiches down in a single layer, alternating between the types of sandwiches as you go. The goal is to create a circular pattern while staying inside the bed of greenery you have created. Once you get the base layer done, pile the rest of the sandwiches one by one onto the base, filling in the gaps and creating different levels of height and composition as you go.
Next, go around the board and evenly distribute the little white stars you saved from the Holiday Sprinkle Sandwiches. You can layer them or fill in some of the gaps if there are any. 
I also opted to add in a few cherry tomatoes to make the wreath look more festive and colourful.

Canada Day Charcuterie Board,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 8 ,"Gather together a bunch of red and white snack foods to assemble this super easy Canada Day Charcuterie Board! Your friends and family will love filling up on these festive snacks. Set the board down right into the middle of your patio table, and let everyone help themselves! All you need is a bunch of napkins and lots of ice cold drinks! Happy Canada Day!",Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins,NA,NA,Total Time 30 minutes mins,12 servings,6,"The amount of people you are serving and the number of items you have to place on the board, will help to determine the size you will need. I’m using an 18 inch wooden board that I got from Amazon. Because I’m working with red food, which can have a lot of natural and synthetic food dye, I oiled my board well with mineral oil first to avoid stains. You can find these types of serving trays at any home decor store, like Marshalls or Winners. You can certainly use a large cutting board too.
When I start to build the board, I want to create contrasting layers, meaning that I tried my best to not put two items of the same colour next to each other. I also made use of a few bowls, which will allow you to pile things higher and keep them neat and tidy. This creates height and depth, which can elevate the look of your final product in term of visual presentation. Note that even the bowls are white and red! Anything wet, like the tomatoes and the bocconcini should be placed in bowls.
The thing about assembling a charcuterie board is that you can easily move things around if something doesn’t work, visually speaking, for you. I like to start with placing the bowls on the board first. You won’t want to move your delicate items like the fruit, for example, around too much, because you run the risk of breaking them or mussing up their finish. Start with the firmer candies and chocolate first. Use the berries as fillers, because they are great for filling in the gaps.
Next, let’s set the little serving bowls into place. On this board, I’m using a total of five bowls. I have a bowl of tomatoes and a bowl of bocconcini. I also have a bowl of red jelly beans, yogurt covered peanuts, and little white candy hearts. Space them apart. No two bowls should be touching.
When that is done, it’s time to fill in the gaps. This is where I use a lot of berries and candy. Go around the perimeter of the board, adding piles of goodies, or stacking them neatly like I did with the spiral red licorice and the cherry twists. I overlapped the chocolate toonies and loonies on the board to add some shiny contrast. Even on a red and white Canada Day board, there has to be a little wiggle room for bling!
Finally, it’s time to add some decorative touches. This is optional, but I included a string of wooden beaded garland to my final presentation. I allowed the garland to drape across the board, spilling out onto the sides. This makes the board look bigger and creates the image that there is so much on the board that it is spilling over. I also placed the board onto a red and white gingham table runner. This makes the board look fuller and adds to the festive look of your celebration!

Next, add the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, peanut butter, maple extract, and maple syrup to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power for 30 seconds, stir, and microwave again in increments of 5 or 10 seconds, stirring with a rubber spatula after each increment, until the mixture is silky smooth.
Add in the mini marshmallows and one cup of the red M&M candy.  Use a rubber spatula to fold them in until each marshmallow is well coated.

Allow the chocolate to firm up at room temperature.  If you refrigerate it to speed up the re-hardening of the chocolate, you run the risk of separating the milk solids. That will result in a chocolate with white streaks through it. It’s best to let it sit at room temperature for two or three hours.

Easter Charcuterie Board,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,NA,NA,"Gather together all of your Easter basket goodies and assemble an Easter Charcuterie Board for your friends and family. It's such an easy way to serve up dessert after dinner, because everything is ready to go, and there's no mess or fuss. All you need is a bunch of napkins and cups of hot coffee for everyone, because coffee and chocolate cannot be beat!",Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins,NA,NA,Total Time 30 minutes mins,12 servings,5,"When I start to build the board, I want to create a centerpiece or a focal point, like I mentioned previously. I’m using two solid chocolate bunnies that I propped up with food-safe pink paper grass. Note that I also nestled small bowls of candy coated chocolates under the ears of each large chocolate bunny. The paper grass will evenly flatten under the weight, but the bowls will keep the bunnies slightly elevated.
The thing about assembling a charcuterie board is that you can easily move things around is something doesn’t work, visually speaking, for you. I like to start with placing the baked goods on the board first. You won’t want to move your baked goods around too much, because you run the risk of breaking them or mussing up their finish. Get those into place first, before moving on to the chocolates and candies.
Next, let’s set the little serving bowls into place. On this board, I’m using a total of five bowls. I have a bowl of regular M&Ms, a bowl of peanut M&Ms, a bowl of marshmallow creme eggs, a bowl of Hershey’s white chocolate speckled eggs, and finally, a bowl of Reece’s Peanut Butter Cups. Two of those are individually wrapped and didn’t need bowls, but using bowls creates texture and keeps things in one place too.
When that is done, it’s time to fill in the gaps. This is where I use a lot of wrapped confections. I have a bunch of purple foiled wrapped Cadbury bunnies, larger hollow chocolate eggs, a few Cadbury Creme Eggs, some mini Lindt Chocolate Bunnies, and some mini foil-wrapped chocolate eggs. I also placed a few unwrapped KitKat bunnies in a standing up position, once again, creating height.
Finally, it’s time to add some decorative touches. This is optional, but I included a bunch of wooden beaded carrots on the side of the board. This makes the board look bigger and creates the image that there is so much on the board that it is spilling over. I also placed a few string-wrapped decorating carrots around the board, and some craft store babies breath and daisies. These just add a spring-like look.

Perfect for kids, but great for adults who like to play with their food too!",Recipes,Prep Time 1 hour hr,NA,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr,16 servings,10,"Remove the lid from the egg carton so that you are left with only the bottom part. Turn it upside down and place it onto a cutting board.
Puncture the top of each inverted egg holder. To do this, use the tip of a small, sharp knife. You will only need to put in small punctures – just a slit. 
When transferring the finished popsicles to the egg carton, be sure to load up the carton from end to end, meaning place one popsicle at one end and then a second at the other end. Working back and forth like that you will balance out the weight being loaded onto the carton and will prevent it from toppling over.
Next, add the sprinkles to a wide, shallow bowl.  Set aside.
Working with one individually wrapped Rice Krispie Treat at a time, unwrap it and place flat on a cutting board. Use a knife to cut off the upper corners. Using the cutting board as a flat, hard surface, pick up the treat and gently round out the upper edges so that they are rounded out. Push the treat into the cutting board and roll it to round out the top. Next, lay the treat flat on the cutting board and with one palm placed on top of the treat, gently, but firmly, push the popsicle stick into the treat.  Repeat this will all 16 treats.
Transfer one cup of the melts to a microwave-safe bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable oil or coconut oil. Microwave the candy melts in 15-second increment, stirring well between each increment. When completely smooth, transfer to a Ziploc bag and cut off the tip.
Holding one popsicle at a time, drizzle the melted candy melts in a zig-zag pattern on one side. Turn over the popsicle and repeat the drizzle on the other side. Holding the popsicle over the bowl of sprinkles, top each side with sprinkles, allowing the excess to fall back into the bowl.
Transfer the decorated popsicle to the egg carton. Carefully push the popsicle stick into one of the pre-punched holes. Push the stick down into the carton until it touches the cutting board under the egg carton. Move on to the next popsicle. Repeat until all Rice Krispie Treat Popsicles are decorated.
Once the candy melt drizzle has re-hardened, insert the popsicles into a cellophane bag and tie string or ribbon tightly around the stick end.
Packaged popsicles should be stored in a large Ziploc bag or a large container with a tight-fitting lid. This will keep the treats tasting fresh and will prevent them from drying out.

Add the vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed pot, much like a Le Creuset or Staub.  (You’ll want to use a pot with a tight-fitting lid.)  Turn the heat to medium and allow the oil to heat up.  In the meantime, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Fry the short ribs for 3-4 minutes on each side.  You're not cooking the beef all the way though, but just browning the outside and searing the meat.  Do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.  A good rule of thumb is to prevent the short ribs from touching each other or the sides of the pan.  Place the cooked meat on a plate while the next batch is cooking.  Once all ribs have been seared, drain the oil and carefully wipe out the pot with paper towel.
Next, whisk together the brown sugar, vinegar, water, mustard, ketchup, and soy sauce.  Stir in the onions.  Set aside.
Pile the cooked short ribs back into the pot.  Pour the sauce mixture over top.  Move the short ribs around so that they are covered by the sauce as much as possible.  Place a lid on the pot and bake for two hours, checking and gently stirring every 30 minutes.

You're going to love these shortcakes!",Recipes,Prep Time 1 hour hr, Cook Time 20 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr 20 minutes mins,6 servings,18,"Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside. I’m using a two thirds sheet pan (also referred to as a three quarter size sheet pan) and measures 21 x 15″.
In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar for 2 to 3 minutes or until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and blend well into the sugar and butter mixture. Next, add the vanilla and beat that into the batter.
Scrape down the bowl and add the following ingredients in this order: flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the dry ingredients into the wet until well combined.  Add the milk and fully incorporate.
Coat the parchment lined baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Be sure to spray the sides of the pan! Pour the batter into the pan and use a rubber spatula to press down so that the entire pan is covered.
Bake for 20 minutes, testing with a toothpick for doneness. Remove from oven. Place the pan on a cooling rack and let set for 10-15 minutes. Next, place a cooling rack onto the cake and carefully invert the cake onto the rack and out of the pan. Remove the parchment paper and allow the cake to fully cool.
Start by adding the butter to the mixing bowl, and using the paddle attachment, whip the butter for 5-7 minutes. Be sure to scrape down the bowl a time or two in between.
Add two cups of confectioner’s sugar to the bowl and beat on low speed until just incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and beat again to just combine. Now, add two more cups of confectioner’s sugar and beat until incorporated. Increase the speed and beat well for another two to three minutes.
Finally, add the whipping cream or milk. Beat well into the buttercream mixture for three to five minutes. Be sure to scrape down the bowl before this one last mix. Once buttercream is mixed, cover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature. Do not refrigerate. Once the cakes are cooled and ready, beat the buttercream again for another minute before using.
Slide the cake onto a large cutting board, or onto your kitchen counter. Place a sheet of parchment paper onto your counter first, if you are not using a cutting board. Use a large circular cookie cutter to cut twelve circles out of the cake.
Transfer a quarter of the buttercream to a large piping bag with a small round piping tip. (I used #803.) Add the rest of the buttercream to another piping bag fitted with a medium-sized rosette tip. (I used #826.) 
Place the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs into a bowl that is at least six inches wide and has a good inch or so of depth to it. You will use this to dip the layers of cake into to coat them with the crumb mixture.
Working with one cake round at a time, and using the round piping tip, cover the surface with buttercream. You’ll use about two tablespoons of buttercream to cover the cake round. 
Next, invert the round and press it lightly into the bowl of shortcake crumbs. This will help the crumbs stick to the buttercream. Place the cake round, crumb-side up, onto a serving plate or large platter. 
Next, using the rosette tip, pipe about a quarter cup of buttercream onto the round. Do this until you have six rounds completed.
Now, place a second cake round onto the top of each of the six previously prepared rounds. 
Using the rosette tip again, pipe about a quarter cup of buttercream onto the round. Do this until you have six rounds completed. 
Spoon a tablespoon of the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs over the top of each stacked cake.
At this point, I like to garnish with a strawberry. If you are serving these cakes immediately, go ahead and garnish now. Otherwise, do not add the strawberry to the top of the cake until you are ready to serve. If serving later, go ahead and gently cover the cakes with plastic wrap.

Copycat Strawberry Shortcake Flakies just might be better than the original store-bought version! Give them a try!,Recipes,Prep Time 30 minutes mins, Cook Time 12 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 42 minutes mins,9 servings,12,"Start by preheating your oven according to the instructions on your puff pastry packaging.  Place a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet and set it aside. Gently unroll the puff pastry. Do this slowly to avoid cracking or tearing the dough.
Using a sharp knife, cut the pastry into nine squares.  Transfer the squares to the prepared baking sheet, leaving about two inches of space between each one. 
Whisk the egg and using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of each square. Once done, sprinkle over the sanding sugar if you’re using it.
Bake the puff pastry according to the instructions on the package. Once done, remove from the oven and carefully lift them off the baking sheet and transfer them to a wire cooling rack.  Allow them to cool completely. 
While the pastries cool, add the softened cream cheese to a mixing bowl and beat until very smooth. 
Next, add the whipping cream and the vanilla bean paste. If you are using extract instead of paste, add it here now. Beat the whipping cream and vanilla into the cream cheese until well incorporated. 
Now, add the sour cream and beat the mixture once again.
Add the confectioner's sugar.  Start with half a cup. Beat it into the cream cheese mixture and taste to see if you are satisfied with the sweetness. If you want it more sweet, add another half cup and beat again. Cover cream and refrigerate until pastries are cool.
Once the pastries are cooled, halve the flakies using a sharp knife.  Gently stand the flakie on its end and carefully slice down the middle, cutting the top half of the flakie from the bottom. Do this with each of the nine squares. 
You can now spread the cream filling onto the bottom layer of the pastry. Because the pastry is delicate, and because I wanted peaked cream filling, I transferred the filling to a piping bag and piped big rosettes onto the bottom layer. If you don’t have a piping bag and tip, you can transfer the cream to a Ziploc bag and cut off the tip. Use the bag to squeeze the cream out in small dollops.
Next, spoon a tablespoon of strawberry jam onto the center of the bottom layer.

No Churn Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,NA,NA,"Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream the easy way – no churn!

Made with cream, real strawberries, and a good helping of shortcake crumbs, who’s up for a big bowl of this delicious frozen treat?",Recipes,Prep Time 35 minutes mins,NA,NA,Total Time 6 hours hrs 35 minutes mins,12 servings,6,"Before you start anything at all, take the bowl you intend to use to beat the whipping cream in, and place it in your freezer. An ice-cold bowl will help to make whipping the cream faster and easier.
If you have not already prepared the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs, do that first. These crumbs take eight minutes in the oven and then at least fifteen minutes of chilling time in the fridge. They’re not cumbersome to make, but from start to finish, you will need about 30 minutes. Get them done and out of you way first.
Next, chop up the strawberries. You can chop the strawberries or mash them. You will want to chop the strawberries well though, because large pieces of strawberry will freeze quite hard and makes the ice cream not as smooth. Also, this recipe uses one cup of chopped strawberries. You can add more, but do no exceed two cups, because the excess moisture creates a icy ice cream rather than a creamy one.
Pour the cold whipping cream into the chilled mixing bowl. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer, beat the cream until it forms stiff peaks. At this point, add food colouring to tint the ice cream if desired.  Also, add the vanilla bean paste or extract.  Beat into the whipped cream.
Next, while still beating, pour the canned sweetened condensed milk into the bowl in a steady, slow stream. Don’t empty the contents of the can in and then beat. The whipped cream will lose its fluffiness. Slow and steady wins the race. When no more pours out of the can, scrape the rest out with a spatula. You’ll want to use every drop!
Finally, add in the chopped or mashed strawberries, along with one cup of the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs. Use a spatula to fold the ingredients into the whipped cream mixture. Once done, transfer the ice cream mixture to a freezer-safe bowl or container.

Strawberry Shortcake Waffles,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,5, 1 ,"Light and airy Strawberry Shortcake Waffles make a perfect weekend brunch item! Prepared with delicious homemade waffles and layered with whipped cream, sliced fresh strawberries, strawberry shortcake crumbs, and syrup, this is one scrumptiously impressive and flavourful treat!",Recipes,Prep Time 40 minutes mins, Cook Time 20 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr,3 servings,8,"If you have not already prepared the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs, do that first. These crumbs take eight minutes in the oven and then at least fifteen minutes of chilling time in the fridge. They’re not cumbersome to make, but from start to finish, you will need about 30 minutes. Get them done and out of you way first.
Preheat your waffle maker according to the instructions that accompany your appliance.  Preheat your oven to 200 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with a wire cooling rack and set aside.  DO NOT grease the waffle irons yet! 
In a bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the eggs and milk until well combined. Pour in the melted and cooled butter and vanilla bean paste or extract. Whisk to combine and set aside. Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients to combine them.
Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and use a whisk to combine everything together. Do not completely overmix the ingredients. A few small lumps are fine and encouraged. 
Now you can coat the waffle irons. DO NOT use butter! Use a non-stick cooking spray. Butter will burn and some of the water content will evaporate after each use, so by waffle number three, there is bound to be sticking. Avoid sticking by using non-stick cooking spray!
Depending on the size of your waffle maker, scoop out the desired amount of waffle batter and position it right onto the center of the bottom iron. (I’m using 1/2 cup of batter for each waffle.) Close the waffle maker lid and cook according to your maker’s instructions. Cook in batches, keeping cooked waffles warm by placing them onto the prepared baking sheet and keeping in the pre-heated oven.
To assemble, place a waffle onto the center of a plate. Sprinkle over a heaping tablespoon of the strawberry shortcake crumbs. Top that with a layer of sliced strawberries. Drizzle over a little syrup or honey if using. Then, add a few small dollops of whipped cream. Add a few pieces of chocolate if using. Place another waffle onto the pile and layer again in the same order – strawberry shortcake crumbs, sliced strawberries, syrup or honey, whipped cream, and chocolate.
When your stack is to the desired height, garnish with more crumbs and a bigger dollop of whipped cream. Add some more chocolate and little bit more crumbs. Top that with a whole, unsliced strawberry or two, and serve immediately!

Allow the chocolate to firm up at room temperature.  If you refrigerate it to speed up the re-hardening of the chocolate, you run the risk of separating the milk solids.

Chocolate Waffle Cones,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,NA,NA,"When it comes to serving up a scoop of ice cream at home, nothing beats doing so in one of these Chocolate Waffle Cones. Using store-bought cones, the inside is coated with chocolate which prevents ice cream from dripping out the bottom. Anyone with kids will love this!",Recipes,Prep Time 5 minutes mins, Cook Time 20 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr 55 minutes mins,6 servings,8,"Start by setting up a work station.  If using drinking glasses to keep the cones standing up, place 6 drinking glasses onto a platter or baking tray.  This will make it easy to transport to the fridge.
Add one cup of the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl.  On 50% power, and in 30 second increments, melt the chocolate until smooth.
Holding one waffle cone at a time in your hand, ladle in a couple tablespoons of the melted chocolate. Turn the cone slowly, allowing the chocolate to cover the entire interior surface of the cone. If there’s too much excess chocolate, you can turn the cone upside down and allow the excess to drip back into the bowl of melted chocolate.  Alternatively, you can let the excess chocolate settle into the bottom of the cone.
When done, stand the cone up and move onto the next. When all cones are coated, transfer to your fridge for 30-45 minutes to harden.
Once the first application of chocolate is set, it’s time to get started on the second stage of this recipe. So, with the cones ready, and a bowl of sprinkles nearby, melt the remaining chocolate using the same technique.  
Again, working with one cone at a time, hold it upside down and dip it straight down into a bowl of melted chocolate. Very gently shake the cone in an up and down fashion. This will force the excess chocolate to drip off and back into the bowl of melted chocolate.
Next, hold the cone over the bowl of sprinkles. Use a spoon to spoon the sprinkles over the still wet, melted chocolate. Allow the sprinkles to stick to the chocolate while keeping the cone held over the bowl so that the sprinkles that don’t stick and fall back into the bowl. Turn the cone, spooning more sprinkles over it, until the dipped portion of it is covered in sprinkles. Return the cone to its previous resting place so that the chocolate can harden once again.

In the meantime, fill a heavy-bottomed pot, such as a Dutch oven or a deep, cast iron skillet with at least three inches of oil. Heat the oil to 350 degrees.

To assemble the rolls, remove one wrapper from the package and lay it onto a flat surface, like a cutting board, in a diamond shape.
Spoon two heaping tablespoons of the filling onto the lower half of the wrapper.

The tomatoes are left whole so that they will slightly blister and pop as they cook. As the tomatoes cook, you can purposely burst a few of them with the back of a wooden spoon to help them along. Cook for 8-10 minutes.

Start by laying a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet.  Place in your oven and heat your oven to 200°F.  You will fry the beef in batches.  Once the beef is fried, place it on the cooling rack and keep in the warm oven while the next batch is frying.  Don't pile the beef.  Spread it out on the cooling rack.

Add enough oil to a heavy-bottomed pan, such as a Dutch oven, so that the oil is 3-4 inches deep.  Bring the oil to 350°F.  While the oil is heating, continue with the next step.
Add the cornstarch to the beef mixture and toss well to coat.  All of the beef pieces should be dusted with the cornstarch.  
Fry the beef in batches.  Do not overcrowd the oil.  Too much beef will cause the oil to drop in temperature.  Cooler oil means greasy or soggy beef.  Each batch will take about 6-7 minutes.  Once the beef is browned, lift out of the oil and place on the pre-heated cooling rack.  Keep in the oven while you continue to cook the beef in batches.
Once all of the beef is cooked, place a large skillet over medium heat.  Carefully spoon two tablespoons of the oil used to fry the beef into the skillet.  
Add the garlic, onion, and peppers.  Stir to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Pour in the sauce and stir into the onion and peppers.  Once the sauce begins to boil (bubble) add the fried beef.  Toss everything together.

Trim the blossom end and discard.  Cut each crab apple in half across the center.
Add the prepared crab apples and water to a large pot.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce and simmer for 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to mash the apples.  Don't over-mash, just break the apples up a bit.
Next, strain the mixture through a double layer of cheesecloth.  Don't force the liquid through.  Allow it to seep through slowly.  Let the mixture strain for 2-3 hours.
While the jelly is straining, wash the mason jars and screw lids in soapy water and rinse soap off well under running hot water.  Place clean jars on a baking sheet and place in oven preheated to 200 degrees.  Set screw bands aside.  Next, boil a kettle of water and pour into a clean glass bowl.  Carefully submerge the sealing discs in the bowl of hot water.  Set aside.
Discard the solids and transfer the juice to a clean pot.  Add the sugar and stir.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cook until the jelly reaches a temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit.  You can use a candy thermometer to test the temperature. 
Using a canning funnel, fill the jars leaving 3/4 inch head space.  Wipe down the rim of each jar with a damp paper towel to ensure none of the jelly has come in contact with the rim.
Carefully remove the sealing discs from the hot water with a magnetic lid lifter.  Position the sealing disc directly onto the lid of the jars.  Do not touch the underside of the lid.  
Screw on the screw bands until firm – do not apply pressure!  Just use your fingertips to tighten the screw bands.
Next, prepare your pressure canner according to the instructions for your particular brand, make, or model.
Using the jar lifter, place the jars into the canner and place the lid on securely.
Process for 20 minutes using a 10 pound (69 kPa) weighted gauge.  Be sure to adjust pressure for your altitude if over 1000 feet.  Time the processing from the time the canner has reached full pressure.  Once done, turn off the heat and allow canner to de-compress naturally.  
Carefully remove each jar from the canner using the jar lifter.  Do not tilt the jars or try to wipe them dry.  Place jars onto a wire cooling rack that has been covered with a clean kitchen towel.  
Leave the jars to cool for a minimum of 12 hours.  Once cooled, wipe the jars of any residue that might have been transferred to the outside of the jar during the boiling process.  Label the jars and store in a dark, cool cabinet.",3,6 pounds crab apples,6 cups sugar,6 cups water,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/crab-apple-jelly/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a hand-held mixer, beat together the cream cheese, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.  Set aside.
Unroll the puff pastry and gently roll it out with a rolling pin.  We are not trying to make the puff pastry flatter or bigger, but simple leveling out the surface.
Choose two round cookie cutters.  The larger cookie cutter should be about 3 inches in diameter.  The second cookie cutter should be about 1/4-1/2 inch smaller.
Using the largest cookie cutter, cut circles out of the puff pastry.  Place the circular puff pastry onto the prepared baking sheet at least 3 inches apart.
Using the second cookie cutter, position it in the middle of each previously cut puff pastry and gently push down to make a small indent.  DO NOT cut all the way through.  We are basically scoring the pastry to prevent the filling from running out onto the crust when baking and to encourage the crust to puff up more than the center.
Next, use a fork to gently poke the center of the prepared puff pastry.  I tend to poke the pastry a total of 4 times and make an X or a cross-like pattern.
Add a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture to the center of the prepared puff pastry and spread it evenly, but do not spread it past the inner score.  Keep the outer crust free of any toppings!
Fill in the center of the tart with the berries, pushing them gently into the cream cheese mixture so that they stick.
Next, whisk together the egg and the tablespoon of water.  Brush the outer crusts of the prepared puff pasty with the egg mixture.  Use a small pastry brush for best coverage.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the outer crusts are puffed and golden brown.

Next, place the butter into a stainless steel frying pan.  Turn the heat to medium low.  Allow the butter to melt.  Once the butter starts to bubble, use a whisk to keep the butter moving.  Continuously stirring until the butter has turned a deep amber colour.
Don't walk away from the bubbling butter.  It will burn very easily.  The butter will bubble and will form a thick, white foamy/frothy top.  Keep whisking slowly.  This is normal and will soon evaporate.
Next, add the garlic and stir into the butter.  The garlic will sizzle and pop.  The butter is quite hot, so it's important to move quickly.

Place clean jars on a baking sheet and place in oven preheated to 200 degrees.  Set screw bands aside.  Next, boil a kettle of water and pour into a clean glass bowl.  Carefully submerge the sealing discs in the bowl of hot water.  Set aside.
Wash the fruit very well and dry with paper towels.  Using a paring knife, peel the fruit like you would an apple.  Try to peel away as little of the pith as possible.
Once all the fruit has been peeled, turn the pieces over so that the pith side is facing up.  Using the paring knife still, gently but firmly scrape away the remaining pith.
Slice the peel into roughly 1/8th of an inch slices and transfer to a small cooking pot with the water and baking soda.  Stir and bring to a low boil.  Boil for 20 minutes.
Still using the paring knife, peel away the remaining pith from the fruit.  Next, working over a bowl to catch the juice, carefully slice down each side of the membrane to remove each section of the fruit.  Discard the seeds and squeeze the remaining membrane in your hands to collect all of the juice.
Add the fruit sections and pulp, along with the juice, to the pot.  Stir to combine.  Cover and gently boil for 10 minutes.
In the meantime, fill your water bath canner to the halfway mark with water and add the jar rack.  Bring to a full boil.
Next, add the sugar and stir to combine.  Stir until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has returned to a low boil.  Allow the mixture to boil for 10 minutes, stirring often.  As you approach the 7-8 minute mark, stir constantly to prevent the fruit from burning.
Ladle the marmalade into prepared mason jars using a funnel to prevent the sauce from touching the rim of the jars. 
Use the non-metallic bubble remover to remove any air bubbles.
Wipe down the rim of each jar with a damp paper towel to ensure no sauce has come in contact with the rim.
Carefully remove the sealing discs from the hot water with a magnetic lid lifter.  Position the sealing disc directly onto the lid of the jars.  Do not touch the underside of the lid.  
Screw on the screw bands until firm – do not apply pressure!  Just use your fingertips to tighten the screw bands.
Using the jar lifter, place the jars into the water bath canner with the boiling water.  Do not place the lid on the canner.
Boil for 20 minutes.  Carefully remove each jar from the canner using the jar lifter.  Try not to tilt the jars.  Place jars onto a wire cooling rack that has been covered with a clean kitchen towel.

The cookies are now ready to eat.  If you are storing the cookies, lay them in a single layer in a container and top with a dusting of the leftover confectioner’s sugar.  Be sure to sprinkle the sugar between each layer.  These cookies can be frozen.",6,2 1/2 cups confectioner’s sugar,2 1/4 cup all purpose flour,1/4 teaspoon salt,"1 cup butter, room temperature",1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"3/4 cup pecans, finely grated (see notes)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/russian-christmas-tea-cakes/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Being sure the rim of the jar is clean and jam-free, wipe the lid with a damp cloth, place on the seal and tighten the lid until a slight resistance is met.
Carefully place the jar on a kitchen towel where the jar will not be disturbed for twelve hours.
Once the jam begins to cool, the seal will create a popping sound, assuring you that the jar is sealed.

Gingerbread Truffles,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,4.10, 11 ,"Nothing compares to the warming and comforting taste and smell of gingerbread at Christmastime. These Gingerbread Truffles are the perfect bite-sized treat for sharing. And, they make a perfect bring-along treat to any festive party!",Recipes,Prep Time 20 minutes mins, Cook Time 30 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 50 minutes mins,48 truffles,8,"In a food processor, pulse the gingerbread cookies with the ground ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon until the cookies are finely crushed.
Remove ½ cup of the cookie crumbs and set aside.
Add the softened cream cheese and pulse until all of the cookie crumbs are mixed well with the cream cheese. Scoop the batter into a large bowl. Cover with cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Use the smallest ice-cream scoop you can find (these are so rich, smaller is better!) and roll into balls and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once you’ve rolled all of the balls, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 60 minutes.
Prepare your chocolate in a double boiler.
Remove each cookie ball from the baking tray and very slightly insert a toothpick into the ball. Use the toothpick to dunk the cookie ball into the chocolate. Be sure to completely submerge the ball into the melted chocolate.
Place the chocolate covered ball back onto the parchment paper, leaving the toothpick inserted. Get another toothpick and move on to the next ball. (Leaving the first chocolate covered ball on the parchment paper with the toothpick in place while you move on to dunking a second ball, will allow the first ball to set and the toothpick will be easier to remove without causing any damage to the smoothness of the chocolate coating.)
Immediately after removing the toothpick, sprinkle with the gingerbread crumbs you had set aside earlier. Try to hide the hole left behind from the toothpick with sprinkled cookie crumble. Once you have dipped and sprinkled each ball, return the baking tray to the refrigerator for another hour to ensure the chocolate is entirely set.",7,20 ounces gingersnaps,"16 ounces cream cheese, softened",½ teaspoon ground ginger,½ teaspoon ground cloves,½ teaspoon ground cinnamon,1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg,3 cups milk chocolate chips,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/gingerbread-truffles/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Sour Cream Scones,Lord Byron’s Kitchen,3.93, 53 ,"Light and fluffy, these Sour Cream Scones are just the thing for those warmer weather intimate brunches.  Brew some coffee and tea; company's coming!",Recipes,Prep Time 15 minutes mins, Cook Time 15 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 30 minutes mins,8 scones,8,"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking sheet or parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, sift and combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon.  Set aside.
Separate the egg yolk from the white.  Save the yolk for the last step before baking.
In another bowl, whisk together the egg white, melted butter, and sour cream. (If you are adding an extract – vanilla or anything else, add it now, but no more than 2 teaspoons)
Once mixed, add the dry ingredients, and your add-in, to the wet ingredients and stir until most of the ingredients have come together.  DO NOT over mix the dough.  Mix just until the flour is incorporated.
Using a large ice-cream scoop, scoop the dough out onto the baking sheet.  I used a half cup scoop size. 
Add one tablespoon of water to the egg yolk and whisk to combine.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of each scone with the egg yolk mixture.  Sprinkle over about a half teaspoon of course sugar, if using.
Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and immediately remove from baking sheet and transfer to a wire cooling rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.",13,1 large egg,"3 tablespoons butter, softened","2/3 cup sour cream, 5%",2 1/4 cups all purpose flour,2 teaspoons baking powder,1/2 teaspoon baking soda,1/3 cup brown sugar,1/4 teaspoon cinnamon,3 tablespoons granulated sugar,1/4 teaspoon salt,"1/2 cup dried berries or fruit, optional","4 teaspoons course white sugar, optional",1 tablespoon water,NA,NA,NA,Lord Byron's Kitchen,https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/sour-cream-scones/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
