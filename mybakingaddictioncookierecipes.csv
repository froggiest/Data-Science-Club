Salted Caramel Pretzel Cookies,Jamie,4.84,6,35 minutes,12 minutes,Chilling Time: 2 hours hrs,NA,36 cookies,8,"Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams up and then browns. This should take about 6–8 minutes. Don’t take your eyes off it because no one wants burnt butter bits in their cookies. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for 15 minutes.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with an electric mixer or wooden spoon (yes, you can mix this dough by hand) combine the sugars, salt and cooled brown butter. Mix until smooth.
Add in the eggs and vanilla and mix until combined.
Stir together the flour and baking soda and gradually add it to the butter mixture. Mix until it just comes together, but don’t overmix. Fold in the caramel chips and pretzel pieces. If making the dough by hand, the chips may not seem to mix into batter very well due to the melted butter, so I like to place the dough into a gallon zip-top bag and kind of roll the dough into a log to push the chips into the dough while it chills.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. I typically shoot for overnight, but you can go as long as 24 hours.
When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper.
Let the dough sit out at room temperature while the oven preheats. It will be quite hard until it sits out for a bit.

Stir together the flour and baking soda and gradually add it to the butter mixture. Mix until it just comes together, but don’t overmix. Fold in the chocolate of your choice.
