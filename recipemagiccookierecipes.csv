Snowman Cookies Starbucks recipe,Anjali,"Oct 11, 2022",4,6,NA,12 minutes,2 hours before baking: 2 hours hours,Total Time: 4 hours hours 12 minutes minutes,Servings: 24 cookies,31,"Whisk dry ingredients in a medium-size mixing bowl.
In a large mixing bowl using a hand held mixer or stand mixer combine unsalted butter and sugar on high speed for 2-minute. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract.
Combine wet ingredients and dry ingredients and form a dough. If you feel the dough is too soft and isn't in a rolling consistency then add 1 tablespoon more flour or until it is in a better consistency for rolling.
Divide the dough into two equal parts.
Lightly flour a nonstick silicone mat or a piece of parchment paper. Roll the dough until its about 1/4 inch thick. The shape of the rolled dough doesn't matter.
Stack the rolled out dough with a piece of parchment paper in between the two onto a 15x21 inch large baking sheet.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or for 2 days. If you are chilling for more than 2 hours then top the rolled out dough with a piece of parchment paper.
Once the dough is chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Line a 15x21 inch large baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.
Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and use a snowman cookie cutter to cut out as many snowmen as you can. Re-roll the remaining dough to make more snowmen. Repeat the same with the other piece of dough.
Arrange the snowmen cookies on a lined baking sheet keeping a gap of at least 3-inches between each cookie.
Bake for 12-minutes or until lightly browned on the edges.
Allow the cookies to cool down on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them onto a wired rack for further cooling. I like to wait until the cookies cool down completely before decorating them.
Finally, bring them back to the baking sheet. I prefer decorating them on the baking sheet. That way, I can keep them in the refrigerator to speed up the chilling process.
Whisk all of the ingredients for icing using a hand-held mixture or a stand-mixer with a whisk attachment. Whisk on high for 1-2 minutes.
The consistency should be silky smooth. Lift up the icing using a spatula and it should flow down slowly taking 5-10 seconds to fall into the icing bowl.
If the icing is too thick then add more water. I generally add 10-12 tablespoons or more of water if my icing is too thick.
If the icing is too watery, then add a little more confectioners' sugar.
You will need five small bowls. Arrange the icing in each bowl. Remember you will need significantly more white icing than any other color. So divide the icing accordingly.
Use red food color for the first, orange for the second, black for the third, brown for the fourth and leave the last one white.
Spoon the icing in individual reusable or disposable piping bags.
Use round tip #5 or round icing tip #4 to cover the snowmen with white, leaving space for the hat. Allow the white to set. Put the baking sheet in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process.
Next use the same icing tip (i.e. #5 or #4) to pipe the red scarf.
Now use round icing tip #1 to pipe the hats with brown icing.
Use the same round icing tip #1 to pipe the black buttons and eyes.
Finally use the same round icing tip #1 to pipe the orange nose.
And, lastly, use the same icing tip i.e. round icing tip #1 to pipe white polka dots on the scarf.
Leave out the decorated snowman cookies at room temperature for 2 hours.
Enjoy the snowman cookies right away. Or wait until the icing sets completely. Once the icing has set you can send these to your neighbours or keep them in your snowman cookie jar or send them to someone as a christmas gift.
These decorated snowman sugar cookies will stay soft and fresh for up to 5 days when kept tightly closed in a container at room room temperature.

In a separate mixing bowl whisk the dry ingredients - Flour, Baking powder, Baking Soda, Ground Cinnamon, Ground Cloves, Ground Ginger, Kosher Salt, and Allspice.
Combine the wet mixture with the dry mixture to make a dough. The Gingerbread cookie dough will be slightly sticky to touch. Pat it down to make a disc shape. Divide the cookie dough into two halves. Wrap each with plastic foil and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or for about 3 days.
First of all, preheat your oven to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then take a baking sheet and line it up with parchment paper. You can also alternatively use silicone baking mats as they are best for baking cookies. 
Now take out your chilled discs of cookie dough and place them on the kitchen surface. Spread plenty of flour underneath so that the dough does not stick to the surface. Then take a large rolling pin and roll out the dough into a flat sheet of about ¼ of an inch thickness. 
Once you have rolled out the dough into a flat sheet you can start cutting shapes into it. Use a cookie cutter for making fun shape with your family. This is the most fun part of making gingerbread cookies! 
Once you have cut all the shapes you can place them on the baking sheet. Make sure each shape is spaced evenly and has space to breathe and expand. Now all you need to do is slide the baking sheet into the oven and let the cookies bake for about ten minutes. 
Once the baking time is over take the cookies out of the oven and let them rest for about five minutes on the countertop. This way the cookies can cool down. When they are sufficiently cooled down you can decorate them with any icing of your choice.
