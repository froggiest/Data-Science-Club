3 Ingredient Butter Cookies,Jennifer Lee,"by Jennifer Lee on December 23, 2025",5,6,Diet,10 minutes,15 minutes,Chilling Time: 30 minutes mins,NA,32 cookies,6,"Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, add butter and sugar. Cream at highest speed for 3-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. Stop and scrape the sides of your bowl a few times with a spatula to get all the butter incorporated.
Add in the flour. Mix in at low speed and then gradually increase speed once flour is incorporated. The dough should look like a thick paste.
There are a few options for cookie shapes: 1)The easiest method is to scoop the dough with a 1 tbsp cookie scoop and roll into balls. Flatten the dough balls into thick disks, about 1/2 inch thick. Space cookies 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheet. If your dough is too soft to roll and shape, you can refrigerate the dough for a few minutes until firm enough to scoop and shape. 2) Roll the dough into a log, about 1 to 1.5 inches wide. Wrap in plastic and place into fridge until firm, about 30 minutes. Slice the dough into rounds about 1/2 inch thick. Space the rounds 1 inch apart on the cookie sheets. 3) Transfer the dough to a piping bag with an open star tip (I used one with a 1/2 inch opening). The dough is very thick, but it should be pipable with some force. If you’re having trouble moving the dough through the piping bag, I found it helps to massage the dough back and forth inside the piping bag so that it is more soft. If you are still having issues with the dough being too firm, you can add a tiny bit of melted butter (about 1 tbsp) into the dough. Pipe a circle shape, about 1 1/2 inches wide. Space the cookies about 1 inch apart.
Place cookie sheets into fridge for 30-60 minutes until the dough is firm. This is needed no matter what cookie shape you made. This will help prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking. While your cookies are in the fridge, Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
Place one cookie sheet into the middle of your oven (keep the other in the fridge until ready to bake). Bake cookies for about 15-20 minutes or until edges and surface start to turn a light brown. You may need to rotate the cookie sheet halfway so that the cookies brown evenly. Remove cookies from oven and bake the second tray. Let cookies cool on cookie sheet before removing. Once cookies are fully cooled, keep them stored in an airtight container. This prevents them from softening. Cookies can be stored a few days at room temperature and longer in the freezer.",3,"▢ 1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, softened, see note",▢ 1 cup (116g) powdered sugar,"▢ 2 cups (250g) all purpose flour or cake flour (240g), see note before starting",Kirbie's Cravings,https://kirbiecravings.com/3-ingredient-butter-cookie/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

2 Ingredient Healthier Cottage Cheese Chocolate Cookies,Jennifer Lee,"by Jennifer Lee on September 26, 2025",5,4,Diet,10 minutes,15 minutes,NA,25 minutes,20 cookies,7,"Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Add cottage cheese to a high powered blender and blend until completely smooth. The cottage cheese does not need to be room temperature. I used mine straight from the fridge. You will need to stop your blender a few times and scrape down the sides with a spatula to help the blender blend.
Add chocolate chips to a large microwave-safe mixing bowl. Heat in 15-30 second intervals, stirring in between with a spatula, until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
Touch the cottage cheese and it should feel cool but not super cold. If it's still very cold you may want to wait a few more minutes. Add cottage cheese to the bowl of melted chocolate and stir with a spatula until the cottage cheese is fully incorporated. The batter should be uniform in color with no streaks of cottage cheese. The batter should also be thick.
Working quickly, use a 1.5 tbsp cookie scoop to scoop the batter and release it onto your prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies 2 inches apart. The batter should be thick enough that it does not spread out once you release it onto the cookie sheet. You do need to work quickly because as the chocolate cools it will continue to thicken and will make it more difficult to scoop.
Place one of the trays of cookies into the fridge for 15 minutes. This will help the cookie dough firm up further to prevent it from spreading out too much when it bakes. After 15 minutes, the dough should feel firm to the touch. If desired, you can press/smooth any little bits/spikes of batter sticking up from each dough ball.
Bake cookies for about 15-17 minutes or until done. When the cookies are done, they should be puffed up and have a crackly surface. While the first set of cookies are baking, place the second sheet into the fridge for 15 minutes to chill. I recommend only baking one baking sheet at a time. (If you try to bake both at once, the bottom sheet usually does not bake as evenly). Let cookies cool completely on baking sheet before removing and serving. This allows them to set and firm up. If you try to remove them while they are still warm, they will fall apart. Once cooled, they should easily come off the parchment paper.

Add dates to a large food processor. Pulse until the dates are completely smooth and like a paste. This can take a few minutes and you want to stop your food processor and scrape the sides a few times to help it blend. When I make my paste, the dates first break down into smaller pieces and then they roll up into one large ball. If you continue to blend, the ball is broken down again and becomes a mostly smooth thick paste.
Add the almond flour and cocoa powder. Do your best to try to press the mixture into the date paste using a spatula. It may seem very dry at first but the date paste will eventually absorb everything. Blend the mixture in your food processor, stopping a few times to use your spatula to scrape the sides and press the dry ingredients into the date paste until the ingredients are fully incorporated.
Your mixture should appear crumbly, almost like small chocolate crumbs, but when you pinch it together, it should stick. If it is not sticky and your mixture is too dry, you can add a tiny bit of water (about 1-2 tsp) but you need to be very careful because adding too much water will make the cookie dough too soft and sticky to work with and you will then need to add more cocoa or almond flour.

Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer.
Using the wire whisk attachment, beat at medium high speed until the eggs are foamy and soft peaks are starting to form.
With the machine still running, slowly add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of it is added. Do not stop the machine to scrape any sugar that might be on the sides of the bowl. Once all the sugar is added, you can increase mixer speed and continue to beat until mixture is thick, glossy and stiff peaks form. Once the peaks form, you can scrape the sides to get any sugar that stuck to the sides, add it back into the mixture and then beat on high for a few more seconds until that excess sugar is incorporated.
Add in vanilla extract and mix on high speed until it is incorporated and the meringue still has stiff peaks. My meringue softened after adding the vanilla, but beating it at highest speed allowed the meringue to stiffen again. If adding food coloring, add it in now. You will want to mix on high speed for about 30 seconds until the batter is uniform in color. The meringue will be a little softer but still should be medium to stiff peaks
Transfer the meringue to a large piping bag with an open star tip. I used a Wilton 4b tip.
Pipe the meringue into rounds between 1.5 inches and 2 inches wide onto the prepared baking sheet. Try to make the meringues all about the same size. The cookies can be piped pretty close together as they do not spread much. To pipe the shape I made, I piped a circle and then I add another partial layer on top to close up the circle so there is no hole in the middle.
Wet your finger and gently press down on the tops to remove the little points on the cookies.
Put the cookies in the preheated oven and bake cookies for 1 hour. Check on the cookies after 1 hour and if you are able to peel them off the parchment easily, then they are done. When I bake these cookies, they are usually mostly done at the one hour mark but some of them are sometimes not ready if they were a little bigger/thicker/etc. If there are cookies still sticking to the parchment, remove all the cookies that are done and then put the unfinished cookies back in the oven (with the oven off) for an additional 30-60 minutes to allow them to dry/cook further with the residual heat. The cookies are done when you can peel them off the parchment paper.

3 Ingredient Flower Shortbread Cookies,Jennifer Lee,"by Jennifer Lee on April 17, 2025",5,1,NA,30 minutes,12 minutes,NA,42 minutes,14 cookies,9,"In a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer, add butter and sugar. Using the flat paddle attachment on the mixer, cream at low speed until butter and sugar are incorporated and then increase to high speed until light and fluffy (this should only take about 1 minute). Make sure to stop and scrape the sides of your bowl a few times in between mixing to make sure all the sugar and butter gets mixed.
Once your butter mixture is ready, thoroughly scrape all the butter from the sides of the bowl and from the paddle attachment and get it into the middle of the mixing bowl. This is an important step because it will help ensure the butter is evenly distributed. If you leave butter on the sides of the bowl or the paddle attachment, you'll end up with extra butter in parts of the dough which will cause some of your cookies to spread too much. Add in cake flour. Using the lowest speed, mix the flour into the butter mixture just until a dough forms.
If you plan on adding color to your dough, do it now by mixing a few drops of food coloring into the mixer and mixing on low speed until the dough is uniform in color. If you plan on making your cookies more than one color, you will need to divide the dough and then tint the individual doughs. To make your cookies the same colors as mine (no color added for the center, pink and purple petals): set aside a scant 14 teaspoons of the dough. Divide the remaining dough in half (I recommend using a scale). Tint half of the dough light/pastel pink and half of the dough light/pastel purple. Do this by mixing the dough on low speed in your stand mixer with a few drops of food coloring added in.
Cover the doughs in plastic wrap and place into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes or until firm.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Divide the dough into scant 1 teaspoon pieces. If you are making the colors I made, you will divide each tinted dough into 42 pieces (so you should end up with 42 pink petals, 42 purple petals, and 14 plain balls for the center of each flower). You can use a teaspoon measuring spoon to help scoop the dough, but I do recommend weighing the dough balls so you have uniform cookies and don’t end up with some flower petals bigger than others). Roll each dough piece into a smooth ball.
On the prepared baking sheet, arrange the dough balls to form flower shapes. I placed one untinted ball in the center and then surrounded it with six of the same colored balls to create the flower petals. Make sure each of the balls touch. They don’t need to pressed together but they do need to touch. You should have enough to make 14 flowers total. Leave about 1.5 to 2 inches of space between each flower to allow for even baking.
Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the tops and edges of the cookies look set (the cookies won't really brown but they should look cooked and have some small cracks on the surface). Allow the cookies to fully cool before removing them from the baking sheet.

Spread shredded carrots onto one of your lined baking sheets, doing your best to spread the carrots out so they are not clumped together. It's okay if you can't get out all the clumps, but do you best to separate them which will help them crisp up faster.
Add carrots into the oven and bake for about 5 minutes. Watch the carrots carefully because baking time can vary depending on oven, baking pan material, how much moisture is in your carrots and the size of your carrots. The carrots should start to shrivel and turn a lighter color. You want to take them out before they are completely browned (some browning around the edges is okay). Some of the carrots may be done before others. I removed my carrots after 5 minutes and took off the already crisped up ones and then put the rest of the carrots back in the oven for about 3 more minutes to crisp up the rest. It's okay if a few of your carrot shreds get browned-- you just don't want too many of them to be browned. See note section for more details on crisping up the carrots. Set the crisped carrots aside so they can crisp up a little more as they cool.
Add oats to a medium mixing bowl. Drizzle melted coconut oil evenly across. Using a spoon or spatula, stir the mixture briskly for about 20-30 seconds, stopping a few times to scrape the sides of your bowl, until most of the oats look slightly moistened with coconut oil. The oats only need a little oil so they should not look fully wet.
Add in the maple syrup. Mix with your spatula until the oats are evenly coated in syrup and the oats start to clump together.
Measure 2 tbsp of crisped carrots (4 g). You should have slightly more than 2 tbsp on your baking sheet and you can try your best to select the ones that are most yellow and orange and avoid ones that are too browned. Add the carrots to the oat mixture and stir a few times just until they are evenly incorporated.
Using a 1.5 tbsp cookie scoop, pack 1.5 tbsp of oat mixture into your cookie scoop. Release onto your remaining prepared baking sheet. The mixture will be loose and not fully hold together. Use the back of a metal spoon to press, compact and shape your cookie until it becomes a thin round disk (about 1/4 inch thick). Repeat with the remaining mixture. The cookie mixture does not spread or rise during baking so shape your cookies how you want their final appearance to be. If the oat mixture is sticking to your spoon, you can lightly wet the back of your spoon and that should prevent the oat mixture from sticking. It is important to really pat and shape each cookie because that helps the oats compact and stick together, which will help them bind during baking. Try your best to make sure there are no gaps or holes in your cookies.
Bake the cookies for about 13-18 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned and the surface is just starting to brown. Baking time will vary depending on how thick your cookies are. The longer you bake, the crispier the cookies will be but you do want to make sure the edges don't get too dark.
Remove cookies from oven but don't attempt to move them from the baking sheet until they are fully cooled and set. If you try to remove them while they are still warm, the cookies will fall apart. Once they are cooled, the cookies will be fully set and should peel off the parchment paper easily. Store cookies in a sealed container once cooled. If the cookies are left out too long, they will absorb the moisture from the air which will cause them to soften. Cookies can be stored 1 day at room temperature and longer in the fridge or freezer.",4,"▢ 1/2 cup (38 g) finely shredded patted dry carrots, carrots should be patted dry with paper towels before measuring 1/2 cup, see note before starting",▢ 1 cup (90 g) quick oats,▢ 2 tbsp (1 fl oz/30 ml) melted coconut oil,Kirbie's Cravings,https://kirbiecravings.com/4-ingredient-crispy-carrot-oatmeal-cookies/,▢ 3 tbsp (1.5 fl oz/44 ml) maple syrup,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Then add the dates to a food processor and pulse until you have a smooth date paste (a few small flecks of date skin are okay). You will need to scrape the sides of the food processor a few times with your spatula to help the food processor mix.
Bring a nonstick pan to medium heat and add in the shredded coconut. Stirring continuously, toast the coconut until the shreds are golden brown. You will need to move the coconut around as it is toasting to prevent burning. Once the coconut starts browning, I recommend reducing heat to low medium to prevent the coconut from turning too brown too fast. Continue cooking and stirring until all the coconut is toasted.
Transfer the coconut to the food processor with the date paste. Pulse until the coconut is fully incorporated in with the dates (this should only take a few seconds). Your mixture should be a little bit sticky but you should be able to scoop and flatten and shape the mixture.

Touch the cottage cheese when it is done to make sure it is not cold. It shouldn't be after all the blending but if it is still very cold then you will want to let it sit for a few minutes to come to room temperature before adding in the chocolate.

Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer. If you plan on using cream of tartar, add it at this time. See notes section for more details on adding cream of tartar.
Using the wire whisk attachment, beat at medium speed until the eggs are foamy and soft peaks are forming, about 2 minutes.
With the machine still running, slowly add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of it is added. Do not stop the machine to scrape any sugar that might be on the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat until mixture is thick, glossy and stiff peaks form. Once the peaks form, you can scrape the sides of the mixing bowl to get any sugar that stuck to the sides, add it back into the mixture and then beat on high for a few seconds until that excess sugar is incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and add the peppermint extract. Beat for only a few seconds just until the extract is incorporated and stiff peaks still remain.
Fit a large piping bag with an open star tip (I used a Wilton 4B tip).
Position the bag inside a tall glass, folding the top over the rim for stability. If using red gel food coloring, paint four thin, evenly spaced stripes along the inside of the bag. See note section regarding food coloring. See post for picture reference for how the food coloring should look inside the piping bag.
Once the bag is prepped, fill it with meringue. Pipe ovals, between 1.5 to 2 inches long, onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them closely since they won’t spread much (for the photo reference I spaced them very far apart but you can space them much closer, about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch space between each one). To pipe, draw an oval shape, then add a second layer on top to close the center, ensuring there are no gaps. Try to keep the meringues uniform in size. Once you start piping, you do want to work quickly because the meringue mixture will start to weep if left out too long.
Wet your finger and press down on the tops to remove the points on the cookies.
Bake the cookies for 1 hour. After 1 hour, turn off the oven, but keep the oven door closed and keep the cookies inside. Let the cookies sit in the oven for an additional 30-60 minutes (you can open the door briefly after 30 minutes to start checking if the cookies are ready). The cookies are done when you can peel them off the parchment paper. You do want to watch them closely during the last 30 minutes that they sit in the oven because you don’t want them to brown. It’s okay if they turn an off white, slight tan color but you don’t want them browned. The cookies may initially be very crisp when they are done. Let them sit out a few hours uncovered at room temperature until the inside is soft and chewy (but the outside stays firm and should not turn sticky).
Once they reach this stage, they should be transferred to an airtight container.

Once your butter mixture is ready, thoroughly scrape all the butter from the sides of the bowl and from the paddle attachment and get it into the middle of the mixing bowl. This is an important step because it will help ensure the butter is evenly distributed. If you leave butter on the sides of the bowl or the paddle attachment, you'll end up with extra butter in parts of the dough which will cause some of your cookies to spread too much.

Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the wire whisk attachment, beat at high speed until the eggs are foamy and soft peaks are starting to form.
With the machine still running, slowly add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of it is added. Do not stop the machine to scrape any sugar that might be on the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat until mixture is thick, glossy and stiff peaks form. Once the peaks form, you can scrape the sides to get any sugar that stuck to the sides, add it back into the mixture and then beat on high for a few more seconds until that excess sugar is incorporated.
With the beaters still running, pour in the lemon juice and mix until it is fully incorporated (this should only take a few seconds). Your meringue should still have stiff peaks.
Transfer the meringue to a large piping bag with an open star tip. I used a Wilton 4b tip.
Pipe the meringue into oval rounds between 1.5 inches and 2 inches wide onto the prepared baking sheet. Try to make the meringues all about the same size. The cookies can be piped pretty close together as they do not spread much. To pipe, I make mine like I am drawing an oval and then I add another partial layer on top to close up the oval so there is no hole in the middle.
Wet your finger and press down on the tops to remove the points on the cookies.
Sprinkle zest over the cookies. I find it’s easier to work with the zest if it’s been patted very dry with paper towels so that you can easily sprinkle it on without it clumping.
Bake the cookies for 1 hour. After 1 hour, turn off the oven, but keep the oven door closed and keep the cookies inside. Let the cookies sit in the oven for an additional 30-60 minutes (you can open the door briefly after 30 minutes to start checking if the cookies are ready, mine were done around 40 minutes). The cookies are done when you can peel them off the parchment paper. The cookies will initially be very crisp when they are done but if you let them sit out a few hours uncovered at room temperature, the inside will become soft and chewy (but the outside stays firm and should not turn sticky). Once they reach this stage, they can be stored in an airtight container. Be sure to store them in an airtight container because otherwise the outside of the cookies will absorb too much moisture and turn sticky.",3,"▢ 2 large egg whites, brought to room temperature",▢ 1/2 cup (96 g) superfine sugar (caster sugar),▢ 1 tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice + 1 tbsp (5 g) lemon zest,Kirbie's Cravings,https://kirbiecravings.com/3-ingredient-lemon-cloud-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Add quick oats to a food processor. Pulse oats until they become very small and fine and start to partially become flour consistency. See photo in post for reference. I pulsed mine on high for about 30 seconds. If you are unsure if your oats are fine enough, it's better to pulse them a little longer. The smaller they are, the crispier the cookies will be.
Add oats, peanut butter and maple syrup to a large mixing bowl. Make sure you scrape the food processor and get all of the oat powder that sticks to the sides into your bowl. Make sure to also scrape all the maple syrup into your bowl as well as a lot of it gets stuck to the measuring spoon or measuring cup. Mix with a spatula until the ingredients are fully and evenly incorporated and the dough thickens to the consistency of cookie dough.
If using fresh blueberries, wash and thoroughly pat them dry. Cut them in half. Gently fold them into the dough with your spatula. It will be a little difficult because the dough is firm but just do your best not to crush the berries too much and fold them so they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. If using dried blueberries, just add them directly in (no need to cut them) and fold them into the dough.
Using a 1.5 tbsp cookie scoop, scoop dough onto the prepared cookie sheet, spacing the dough balls about 2 inches apart. Use the back of a metal spoon to flatten the dough balls into round disks and smooth the edges. You want the cookies to be fairly thin, between 3/16 inch to 1/4 inch thick. The cookies do not spread much during baking, so shape them as you want the final outcome to be. Try your best not to squish the fresh berries too much because you don't want the dough to get too wet. If your dough is too sticky, you can wet the spoon before using it to flatten and shape.

Add coconut and sugar free honey substitute to a medium mixing bowl. Mix with a spatula until evenly combined and all of the coconut is evenly coated in sweetener. Because of the sticky consistency of the honey, you may have the honey clumping on some of the coconut shreds. Do your best to break up the clumps so that the honey is evenly coated across all of the coconut.

Lightly wet the back of a metal spoon with water and then use it to press and shape the mixture until it becomes a round disk (between 3/16 and 1/4 inch thick). Repeat with remaining mixture, spacing each about 1 inch apart. The cookies don't spread during baking so you can keep them pretty close.
Bake the cookies for about 9-10 minutes or until the edges are browned and the surface is golden brown. The more brown the surface gets, the crispier the cookie will be.

In a large mixing bowl, add butter and sugar. Using the flat paddle attachment, beat at medium speed until lightly and fluffy. You will need to stop and scrape the sides of your bowl once or twice with a spatula so that the butter mixture gets beaten properly. You should not need to beat that long. About 30 seconds total.
Add in flour. Mix on lowest speed (stir setting on my mixer) until flour is completely incorporated. Your dough will look crumbly at first. Do not be discouraged and do not increase speed. Make sure to scrape down the sides a few times because the butter will stick to the bowl. As the flour is slowly beaten in, your dough should start to look less crumbly and clumps should begin to stick together. Continue mixing until the dough becomes a few big clumps.
Add in 2 tbsp (23 g) of sprinkles. Mix dough on low speed for just a few seconds until the sprinkles are evenly spread throughout the dough.
Use a 1.5 tbsp cookie scoop to scoop out dough. Place onto prepared cookie sheet, spaced about 1.5 to 2 inches apart.
Self-rising flour cookie version: Add the remaining sprinkles into a pile on your cookie sheet. Take each dough ball and gently press the top into the sprinkles, so that the top is covered in sprinkles (see photo in post for reference). Be careful not to flatten the dough ball too much when you do this because the cookies will spread during baking.
All purpose flour cookie version: Pick up one of your dough pieces and roll it between your palms to form a smooth ball. Place it back onto the cookie sheet. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the dough ball into a 1/2 inch thick round disk. Because the cookies don't contain baking powder they won't spread as much which is why the dough needs to be flattened a little. Repeat with the remaining dough. Sprinkle each cookie with some sprinkles.

Add 3/4 cup (133 g) mini semisweet chocolate chips to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 15-30 second intervals, stirring in between with a spatula until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. You can also melt the chocolate on the stove using the double boiler method. Set aside to cool slightly.
Add the egg whites to the bowl of a clean stand mixer.
Using the wire whisk attachment, beat at medium speed until the eggs are foamy and soft peaks are just forming, about two minutes. The egg mixture should also turn white.
With the mixer still running, slowly add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of it is added. Do not stop the mixer in between. Increase speed to high and continue to beat until mixture is thick, glossy and stiff peaks form. After you have stiff peaks, you can stop the mixter and use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl, adding any sugar that got splattered back into the mixture. Beat again on high speed for another few seconds or until the sugar is incorporated.
Gently fold in the melted chocolate, a little at a time, being careful not to deflate the meringue. Fold until it’s evenly combined, uniform in color, and no white streaks remain.
Use a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop out the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart.
Use an offset spatula to spread and flatten each mound to a circle about 2 ¼ to 2 ½ inches wide. The batter will be too sticky to make the surface smooth but just spread it in a circular motion. When it is topped with chips and baked (it will puff up a little during baking), the surface will smooth out. You do want to make the cookies at least 2 ¼ inch wide, otherwise it will be too thick and crack during baking.
Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with the remaining mini chocolate chips. Be careful not to have the chips clustered too close together. Too much weight causes the cracks in the cookies and can also cause the chips to fall through.
Bake for 1 hour. When they are done, the tops should feel dry. Let the cookies cool before removing them from the baking sheet. If for some reason you have any cookies still stuck to the baking sheet, they may need slightly longer baking time.

Be careful to only keep them in the oven for one extra hour. If you leave them too long, they will fully dry out inside. When the cookies are done, they will be lightly tanned/off-white in color. They should feel dry on the outside and you should be able to pull them off the parchment paper easily. The cookies will initially be very crisp when they are done but if you let them sit out a few hours uncovered at room temperature, the inside will become soft and chewy (but the outside stays firm and should not turn sticky).

In a large mixing bowl, add butter and sugar. Using the flat paddle attachment on the mixer, cream at low speed just until sugar is incorporated into the butter. Increase your mixing speed to the highest speed and beat until light and creamy (this should only take about 30 seconds). Make sure to pause/stop the mixer and scrape the sides of your bowl with a spatula at least once in between mixing. Once your butter is ready, take a moment to thoroughly scrape all the butter from the sides of the bowl and from your paddle attachment and get it into the middle of the mixing bowl. This is an important step. See notes for more details.
Add in cake flour and unsweetened coconut. Using the lowest speed, mix until a dough forms.
Use a 2 tsp cookie scoop to scoop out dough. If you don't own a 2 tsp cookie scoop you can just measure out 2 tsp of dough with your measuring spoon. Place scooped dough onto prepared baking pan.

If your dough is too sticky, add in 1 tbsp of cornstarch and stir only until the cornstarch is incorporated. If the dough is still too sticky, add in the remaining cornstarch. Your dough should be soft but not too sticky to work with. If it's still too sticky, you can add more cornstarch until it's no longer sticky but the more you add, the more powdery and crumbly your cookies will taste.

In a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, add chocolate chips. Heat in microwave in 15-30 second intervals, stirring in between with a spatula, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. I usually do 30 seconds for the first heat and reduce the time after that depending on how melted the chocolate is. You can also melt the chocolate on the stove using the double boiler method.
Make sure your yogurt has come to room temperature before using (I measure out the amount needed and leave it out for a few hours). Cold yogurt will cause the chocolate to seize. If your yogurt still feels cold to the touch, you can warm it up briefly in the microwave for a few seconds (don't heat too long because you don't want to change the texture of the yogurt). Whisk the yogurt with the melted chocolate until the batter is smooth and no yogurt streaks remain. Your batter should resemble a thick chocolate pudding. Once batter is mixed, you need to scoop it right away. If you let it sit, the chocolate will cool and start to solidify, which you don't want. Using a 1.5 tbsp cookie scoop, scoop batter and release onto prepared baking sheet, spaced 2 inches apart. The batter should be thick enough that it does not spread out once you release it onto the cookie sheet.
If desired, you can apply wet fingers to gently smooth the very top of each cookie ball so that the surface of the cookies will look smoother when they bake. Do not flatten the cookie batter because it will spread during baking. Bake cookies for about 15 minutes or until done. When cookies are done, the surface of the cookies should look cooked. When you apply light pressure to the cookie, it should feel soft inside but not liquid. Be careful not to overcook the cookies because that will dry out the inside.
Let cookies cool completely on baking sheet before removing. Because the cookies are a little delicate, use a thin cookie spatula to remove cookies.

You can either divide dough into 8 equal pieces, or I prefer weigh out the dough. Each dough ball should weigh 6 ounces. You should grab the dough by the handful until you reach 6 ounces and lightly form a very loose ball. Make sure to keep it loose as the cookies should be airy and not compacted (like the owners demonstrate in their video).
Place only four cookies on each baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart, so that they don't spread onto each other. (Please see my photo above for how I spaced them.)
Bake only one sheet at a time in the middle row of the oven, for about 12-13 minutes. The tops of the cookies should be a light brown and the dough should look cooked, but the cookies should not be fully set. Let cookies cool at least 15 minutes.

In a small bowl, sift together sugar and flour. Add to mixing bowl. Mix on medium speed just until flour and sugar are completely incorporated and a smooth batter forms. Be careful not to mix too long. This part should take about 1 minute.
Prepare baking sheets. You will want to prepare at least 2 sheets as you will be making these in very small batches (I recommend making two cookies at a time, and the max I've been able to do before the cookie dough hardens is 3). Cookie sheets need to be lined with silicone baking mat or parchment paper. I preferred how they came out with the silicone mats better. You will be making 3 inches circles on your mats. There are several ways to do this: you can do it free hand and measure them with a ruler; you can use silicone cookie mats that have 3 inch circles already drawn out (like the ones above which I got at Costco); you can print out a stencil of 3 inch circles and place them underneath your silicone mat to guide you which you then remove once you are done.
If you are putting custom messages in your cookies, have them cut and ready.
Measure 1 tsp of batter and place into the center of your circle on the baking mat. Use your finger to slowly thin and spread out the circle until it reach 3 inches in diameter, doing you best to keep your circle smooth and even. It will be a very thin layer of batter, which is what you want. Start with just 2 circles on each baking sheet. I prepared 2 baking sheets and would alternate placing them in the oven. Allow baking sheets to sit for about 5 minutes on a flat surface. The batter should spread ever so slightly and smooth out any slight unevenness in your circles.
Place one baking sheet into the oven and cook for about 5 minutes. You will want to watch closely at the end. You want to cook until the edges are a light brown and it's okay if the middle is still pale or white. Some may cook more than others due to uneven temperatures in the oven or slightly different amounts of batter. Just make sure you don't remove until the edges are brown, otherwise you will not be able to remove them from the cookie sheet.
When they are done, remove from oven and place other baking sheet into oven. Working very quickly, use cookie spatula to remove one of your cookie dough rounds (don't remove the second one yet!). It should be a bit like a pancake and still soft. If you are having trouble getting it to come off the mat with the cookie spatula, you should also be able to peel it right off the mat once you loosen one edge. Once it is peeled off, flip over so the side that was facing down (the rougher looking side) is now facing up. If you have a message, place into middle. Then fold pancake in half. Quickly grab the ends of the fortune cookie and press down on the side of a coffee mug to form fortune cookie shape. Place cookie into a muffin pan mold so that it holds its shape. Repeat with remaining round on baking sheet.
Wipe the cookie sheet and then make 2 more circles in preparation to go into the oven when the ones in the oven are finished. You don't want to put fresh batter on any part of the silicone mat that has cookie crumbles from the last batch, so make sure to wipe clean. Continue and repeat until all of the batter is used up.
If you plan on eating the cookies right away, you can. If you want darker colored fortune cookies or you want these to stay crisp for a longer amount of time, place muffin pans into the just turned off oven (wait until temperature drops to about 200F). Allow fortune cookies to dry out in warm (but turned off) oven for 1 hour. During this time, the fortune cookies will also turn a darker brown and should even out in color. After the hour mark, remove fortune cookies, allow to cool for a few minutes and place in sealed ziploc bags or airtight containers. If desired, you can dip in chocolate and decorate how you wish. Make sure to keep cookies stored in airtight containers though because they will begin to lose their crispness when they sit out for several hours.",4,"▢ 1 egg white, from a large egg",▢ 1/8 tsp vanilla extract,▢ 1/4 cup all purpose flour,Kirbie's Cravings,https://kirbiecravings.com/homemade-fortune-cookies/,▢ 1/4 cup granulated white sugar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until dough is formed. Add oreos directly into batter and beat on low speed until oreos are crushed into small pieces and blended into dough. 
Using a 1.5 tbsp cookie dough scoop, scoop out dough and place into 16 shot glass molds. Using a very small spatula or spoon, spread the dough completely across the bottom of each shot glass mold. Make sure you don't leave any gaps, otherwise, your cookie glass will have holes. I recommend smashing the dough down to really compact it and to the point that the sides of the silicone mold are bulging, and then slowly pushing some of the dough back up so that the silicone mold goes back to its form.The silicone molds should be transparent enough for you to examine for any gaps. Your dough should cover about half of the cookie shot glass mold. Add a second 1.5 tbsp scoop of dough to the molds. Again, spread it across evenly on the sides and also on the top. You should have a thin layer that fully covers the surface. Add about another 1/2 tbsp of dough to cover any remaining gaps and to level the surface. Your dough surface should be just a hair shy of reaching the top edge of the mold (see photo above). You also want to make sure the sides of the shot glass molds are even. Some of the shot glasses may have lost their form in your effort to smash the dough in and you want to make sure all the walls/sides are even again before you bake (see photo above).
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place your silicone molds onto a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top of the molds. This will help prevent the cookie shots from rising too much out of the molds while baking.
Bake for approximately 24 minutes once your oven is heated to 350°F. You want to make sure the cookies are completely done, otherwise dough will be too soft. Allow the cookies to cool. 
Once cooled, use a sharp serrated knife and cut off any cookie dough that may have risen past the molds, so that your cookie glasses will have a flat, even bottom. Place cookies, still in molds, into your freezer for several hours, until cookies are frozen solid.
Once frozen solid, cookie shots should come off the molds pretty easily and in one piece. You may find that despite your best efforts, a few cookie shots may have a small gap/hole. As long as it is small, these are still useable. They won't be as pretty, but once you coat them with chocolate, it should seal the small gaps.
Melt your chocolate on the stovetop. Bring a small pot with water to a simmer. Place a large glass mixing bowl on top of the pot (make sure your bowl is big enough that it won't touch the water or the botto of the pot) and add in the chocolate and oil. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. You want the chocolate consistency to be thin enough to easily spread inside the molds, but also thick enough to provide a seal foor your cookies.
Once chocolate is completely melted, turn off stove, but keep bowl over the pot. Working quickly, use a small spatula to spread white chocolate evenly across the inside of each shot glass, making sure every to coat the entire interior, so that any liquid you pour in does not leak through.
Place shot glasses back in freezer for a few minutes, until chocolate solidifies. I recommend keeping shot glasses in the freezer until shortly before serving. They will defrost and come to room temperature in about 10-15 minutes. Add your milk or other liquids, right before serving. If you properly coated them, they are able to hold liquids for a little while. Time will vary depending on the temperature of the room.

Stir until everything is incorporated and becomes smooth dough ball that is uniform in color. The oreo cookie crumbs should melt into the dough completely from the heat of the butter (see notes). Add in eggs and stir into dough until fully mixed. Dough will lose its ball form and become slightly more sticky. Scoop dough into a pastry piping bag.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats. I used a Wilton #12 round piping tip, but if you don't have one, you can also use other round piping tips about 1/2 inch in diameter at the end or you can snip a 1/2 inch off hole on the bottom of your bag. Pipe spiral cookie rounds onto your baking mats, starting in the middle and working your way out. I piped mine to be 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Slightly push in the tail end of your spiral so that it blends into the last outer spiral, making your cookies look more like circles. Space cookies two inches apart. 
Bake cookies for about 22 minutes or until they feel crisp to the touch. It's okay if your churros are still in a small pool of oil when you pull them out. The oil will absorb into the mat as they cool.

After the dough is firm, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the dough with your 3 cookie cutters. For each pinecone, you will need two of each size. Place cut cookies onto three different baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats, one sheet for each size.
Baking time will vary depending on the size of your cookies. You may want to do a test round of just one of each size first, but luckily, the shortbread is pretty forgiving on time. My largest cookies were about 1 3/4 inch wide and I baked them at 16-17 minutes. The medium ones were about 1 1/4 inch wide and I baked them 14 minutes. The smallest ones were 3/4 inch and I baked them for 9 minutes.

It does not take a lot of water for the sugar to dissolve into a frosting. You want your frosting to be on the thick side, so that it will hold the pinecone layers together. Whisk until frosting is smooth.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Shots,Jennifer Lee,"by Jennifer Lee on Sep 23, 2015 (updated Sep 1, 2022)",NA,NA,Cookies,30 minutes,25 minutes,NA,55 minutes,12 cookie shots,9,"Preheat oven to 350°F. 
In a bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add in eggs and vanilla and mix until batter is smooth. Add in flour, baking soda and salt and mix on lowest speed until smooth dough forms. Stir in 1 cup mini chocolate chips.
Using a 1.5 tbsp cookie dough scoop, scoop out dough and place into one of the shot glass molds. Using a very small spatula, spread the dough so that it is completely spread across the bottom of the shot glass mold. Make sure you don't leave any gaps, otherwise, your cookie glass will have holes. The silicone molds should be transparent enough for you to examine for any gaps. Your dough should cover about half of the cookie shot glass mold. 
Add a second 1.5 tbsp scoop of dough to the same mold. Again, spread it across evenly on the sides and also on the top. You should have a thin layer that fully covers the surface (this is the base of your glass, so you don't want to see the center divider at all), but it shouldn't rise all the way to the rim, since the cookie dough will puff up once baked. If you have any gaps on your surface, add a little more dough. Repeat with remaining dough and molds.
Place silicon mold on a baking sheet. Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until tops turn dark golden brown, with a crispy surface, and a knife inserted comes out clean. Because of the molds, the cookies will take longer to cook. Make sure there is no raw batter remaining. You do not want to undercook these cookies. Some people like undercooked cookies because they are softer, but you want them to be more firm for cookie cups. 
While cookie shots are cooling, slice off any muffin tops from the shot glasses that have puffed up past the rim. You don't want to leave these on as the cookies won't be able to stand evenly. Once the cookies have cooled to room temperature, freeze for several hours until cookies are hard. This will allow you to remove the cookies without breaking them. Once cookies are frozen, gently remove them from silicone molds.
In a glass microwave safe bowl, add the 1 cup of chocolate chips for coating. Microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring after each stop until chocolate is fully melted and smooth. (It should only take around 1-2 minutes.) Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate on the stove. 
Use a small brush or spatula and coat the interior of the cookie shots with melted chocolate, making sure to coat every crevice otherwise the milk will leak through. Briefly freeze the cookie shot glasses again until chocolate hardens (about 20-30 minutes). 
Let cookies soften to room temperature (it should only take about 10-15 minutes) before adding milk. Store remaining unused cookie shot glasses in freezer. Try not to remove cookies from freezer too far ahead of time before eating. While they'll remain standing, they do soften gradually after several hours and it will make them harder to eat.

Add in cocoa, cake flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt and set mixer on lowest speed setting to stir until dough is just combined. You want the dough to be smooth and uniform in color, but you don't want to overmix it, so this should only take a few revolutions and less than 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup of chocolate chips (reserve the remaining 1/3 cup).
Place the dough in the fridge for about 30-60 minutes to chill. You want the dough to be cold (but not to the point that it's hard) so it's less sticky to work with and won't spread too much in the oven.

Turn off the mixer.

Take a peek — if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough — for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don’t be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly.

Using the paddle attachment, mix on medium high speed until everything is completely mixed and becomes light and fluffy (about 2 minutes).
Add in egg and vanilla. Scrape butter mixture from sides of bowl with spatula. Mix on medium speed until egg and vanilla are completely incorporated into the butter mixture.
In a small bowl, add flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture. Turn your mixer speed to the lowest speed possible (usually it is the stir function) and mix the flour until it is only just barely completely incorporated. Be careful not to overmix or the cookies will be more cakey than chewy.
Add in 1 cup of chocolate chunks. Keep the mixer on the lowest speed and mix the chocolate into the batter until the chunks are mixed in. This should only take a few revolutions.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hr.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats. Using a cookie scoop, scoop 3 tbsp of dough for each cookie. Space the cookies at least 2 inches away from the edges of the baking sheet and from each other. The cookies do spread a lot so I would not bake more than 4 at a time. You can always do 1-2 for your first batch so you can see how much they spread.
Add remaining chocolate chunks to surface of cookies balls, placing them in sections where the chocolate is sparse. I like to make sure the surface of the ball is studded with chocolate. Keep in mind the cookies will spread quite a bit so even if it seems like you're putting on a lot, it will look more evenly distributed once they spread out. Place two of the cookie sheets in the fridge to chill.
Place remaining baking sheet onto the middle rack in the oven. Bake for about 12 minutes or until edges are light brown and middle is cooked but not quite set. Allow cookies to fully cool on baking sheet before removing. If you remove cookies before they are set, they will break. For even cooking, only bake one sheet of cookies at a time. Baking multiple sheets at a time will likely lead to an uneven heat distribution.

Using the paddle attachment, mix on medium high speed until everything is completely mixed and becomes light and fluffy (about 2 minutes).
Add in egg and vanilla. Scrape butter mixture from sides of bowl with spatula. Mix on medium speed until egg and vanilla are completely incorporated into the butter mixture.
In a small bowl, add flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture. Turn your mixer speed to the lowest speed possible (usually it is the stir function) and mix the flour until it is only just barely completely incorporated. Be careful not to overmix or the cookies will be more cakey than chewy.
Add in 1 cup of chocolate chunks. Keep the mixer on the lowest speed and mix the chocolate into the batter until the chunks are mixed in. This should only take a few revolutions.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hr.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats. Using a cookie scoop, scoop 3 tbsp of dough for each cookie. Space the cookies at least 2 inches away from the edges of the baking sheet and from each other. The cookies do spread a lot so I would not bake more than 4 at a time. You can always do 1-2 for your first batch so you can see how much they spread.
Add remaining chocolate chunks to surface of cookies balls, placing them in sections where the chocolate is sparse. I like to make sure the surface of the ball is studded with chocolate. Keep in mind the cookies will spread quite a bit so even if it seems like you're putting on a lot, it will look more evenly distributed once they spread out. Place two of the cookie sheets in the fridge to chill.
Place remaining baking sheet onto the middle rack in the oven. Bake for about 12 minutes or until edges are light brown and middle is cooked but not quite set. Allow cookies to fully cool on baking sheet before removing. If you remove cookies before they are set, they will break. For even cooking, only bake one sheet of cookies at a time.

Melt the butter in a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat and heat just until it begins to turn a delicate brown, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour into a medium bowl. Be careful to watch the butter and turn off the heat when it turns brown, or else you will burn it. When you heat the butter, it will boil and bubble and stay a bright yellow for a long time. At some point, it stop bubbling loudly and instead takes on a frothy texture. You can hear the sound difference in the cooking too. It is at this point that the you'll see the liquid begin to brown. As soon as you see most of the liquid turn brown, turn off the stove. See the photo in the post to see what it should look like. When it cools, the froth dissipates and you can see that the whole melted butter liquid is a deep brown like in the photo.
Set the butter aside to cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together the flour and baking soda onto a piece of waxed paper; set aside.
Add the vanilla to the butter, and then stir in half of the sugar, blending well before adding the remaining sugar. Add the flour mixture in two additions, blending well after each addition. Set the mixture aside for 10 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the ingredients.

Using the paddle attachment, mix on medium high speed until everything is completely mixed and becomes light and fluffy (about 2 minutes).
Add in egg and vanilla. Scrape butter mixture from sides of bowl with spatula. Mix on medium speed until egg and vanilla are completely incorporated into the butter mixture.
In a small bowl, add flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture. Turn your mixer speed to the lowest speed possible (usually it is the stir function) and mix the flour until it is only just barely completely incorporated. Be careful not to overmix or the cookies will be more cakey than chewy.
Add in 1 cup of chocolate chunks. Keep the mixer on the lowest speed and mix the chocolate into the batter until the chunks are mixed in. This should only take a few revolutions.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hr.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats. Using a cookie scoop, scoop 3 tbsp of dough for each cookie. Space the cookies at least 2 inches away from the edges of the baking sheet and from each other. The cookies do spread a lot so I would not bake more than 4 at a time. You can always do 1-2 for your first batch so you can see how much they spread.
Add remaining chocolate chunks to surface of cookies balls, placing them in sections where the chocolate is sparse. I like to make sure the surface of the ball is studded with chocolate. Keep in mind the cookies will spread quite a bit so even if it seems like you're putting on a lot, it will look more evenly distributed once they spread out. Place two of the cookie sheets in the fridge to chill.
Place remaining baking sheet onto the middle rack in the oven. Bake for about 12 minutes or until edges are light brown and middle is cooked but not quite set. Allow cookies to fully cool on baking sheet before removing. If you remove cookies before they are set, they will break. For even cooking, only bake one sheet of cookies at a time. Baking multiple sheets at a time will likely lead to an uneven heat distribution.
