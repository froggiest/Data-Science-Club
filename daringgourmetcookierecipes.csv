Berliner Brot,Kimberly Killebrew,5,12,Dessert,German,15 minutes,25 minutes,NA,40 minutes,NA,3,"Preheat the oven to 350 F / 180 C. Grease a 7×11 or 9×13 baking pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. I like to extend the corners of parchment paper up so that I can lift the Berliner Brot out onto a cutting board to cut them.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and hot water until foamy. Add the brown sugar and beat until combined. Add the syrup, rum and vanilla extract and beat until combined.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt.
Add the flour mixture to the wet mixture and beat until combined. Stir in the nuts, candied lemon peel, and finely chopped chocolate. The batter will be very stiff.
Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Bake on the middle rack for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
While the Berliner Brot is baking, prepare the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and water to form a smooth, viscous glaze.
Remove the Berliner Brot from the oven and set the baking pan on a wire rack. While it's still hot, pour over the glaze and spread evenly over the top. Let cool until the Berliner Brot is just warm. Transfer to a cutting board and use a long, sharp knife to cut the Berliner Brot down the center lengthwise and then into rectangles, or into triangles as desired. Let cool completely.
Store the Berliner Brot in an airtight container. The flavor will improve over the next few days. Will keep for a couple of weeks.
Some people like to leave the Berliner Brot out to air dry until hard and crunchy (similar to biscotti) and then store them.

Muscadine Jelly,Kimberly Killebrew,5,3,condiment,"American, Southern",10 minutes,30 minutes,NA,40 minutes,NA,4,"Slice the muscadines down the center and place them in a large pot. Add the water and slowly bring it to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Do not let the fruit burn at any point.
Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low-medium, cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Mash the fruit with potato masher.
Transfer the mashed fruit and liquid to a food mill positioned over a large bowl. Run the fruit mixture through the food mill allowing all the liquid and pulp to go into the bowl. Discard the leftover skins and seeds. Note: If you don't have a food mill you can press the mixture through a potato ricer or scrape it through a large fine mesh sieve.
Measure out 4 cups of juice. If it's just slightly less that's okay. See note below.
Pour the pureed mixture back into the pot. Bring it to a boil and add the sugar and lemon juice, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat slightly but keep it at a steady boil for about 20 minutes or until an instant read or candy thermometer registers 220 F / 105 C. I strongly recommend using a thermometer when you're making jams and jellies without pectin because it takes any of the guesswork out of it it terms of when it's done.
Alternatively you can test it after about 20 minutes with the wrinkle test: Keep a plate in the freezer during the boiling process so it's nice and cold. Pour a small spoonful of the jelly on the cold plate and wait a few seconds before pushing the jelly with your finger. If it has formed a skin on the top and wrinkles when you push it, the muscadine jelly is done. If it doesn't, continue to boil the mixture and test again.
Skim off any foam on top of the jelly.
Ladle the hot muscadine jelly into sterilized jars and secure with lids. If storing in the fridge, let the jars cool completely before placing them in the fridge. Muscadine jelly or muscadine jam will store in the fridge for a few months. Just check for any signs of mold and discard if there is any present.
If canning, follow proper protocol for water bath canning and process the jars for 5 minutes. Carefully remove them, let them cool completely, and store them in a dark, cool place. The muscadine jelly will keep for at least a year.

Cranberry Salmon,Kimberly Killebrew,4.80,15,Main Dish,American,5 minutes,15 minutes,NA,20 minutes,4 servings,2,"Cook the salmon filets. You can choose any method you prefer:
Baked: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place salmon in a baking dish and baked until cooked through, 12-15 minutes. Top with the cranberry sauce and broil for about a minute and serve immediately.
Pan-Fried: Bring the salmon to room temperature before cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Place the salmon skin-side up in the skillet and fry for 4 minutes. Turn the salmon over and fry for another 3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. Cook until the salmon is firm to the touch. Top with the cranberry sauce and broil in the oven for about a minute and serve immediately.
Grilled: Preheat the grill for medium heat. Lightly oil grill grate and place the salmon on the grates skin-side up. Grill for about 4 minutes, turn the salmon over and grill for another 4-6 minutes or until just cooked through. During the last couple of minutes of grilling, top the salmon with the cranberry sauce. Serve immediately.
Sous Vide: Place the salmon filets in heat-safe ziplock resealable bags, pressing as much air out of the bags as you can and seal them tightly shut. Bring the water in your sous vide cooker to 122 degrees F, place the salmon in it and cook for 30 minutes.

Berliner (German Donuts),Kimberly Killebrew,4.95,34,Dessert,German,25 minutes,10 minutes,30 minutes,5 minutes,15 Berliner,4,"Place the flour, sugar, yeast, salt and lemon zest in the bowl of a stand mixer and stir to combine. Add the eggs, butter, vanilla extract, and milk.With the dough hook attached, knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until it's no longer sticky but is soft and supple. Add more milk or flour as needed.
Form the dough into a ball, spray the bowl with oil, and place the dough ball back in the bowl.
Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 45-60 minutes or until doubled in size.
Punch down the dough in the center. Divide the dough into uniform pieces. I like to weigh the dough to get themas close to equal as reasonably possible. At about 80 grams per piece you'll get 15 Berliner donuts.
Using the palms of your hands, roll the dough pieces into balls and place them on a lined baking sheet, keeping space between them to allow them room to rise. Cover them with a clean towel or cover loosely with plastic wrap and let them rise in a warm place for another 30-60 minutes or until nearly doubled in size and nice and puffy.
Make sure to give the dough balls adequate time to rise as this will be crucial for achieving the right texture.
Heat the oil in a deep pan. The oil should be at least 2 inches deep. Keep the temperature between 350-365 F. If it's not hot enough the donuts will soak up the oil and be greasy. If the oil is too hot the outside will burn before the inside is fully cooked. I like to keep it at just over 350 F.
Working in batches, carefully lower a few of the dough balls into the hot oil. The temperature should be such that the Berliner will cook for on each side for about 2 minutes or slightly less. After about 2 minutes, or when the bottom is a deep golden brown, carefully flip the donuts over and continue to cook for about another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown.
Do not at any point submerge the Berliner under the oil otherwise they will not develop the white rim around the center that is characteristic of Berliner.
Remove the Berliner and place them on paper towels to drain. Repeat the process for the remaining donuts.
Once the Berliner are cool enough to handle, it's time fo fill them.
Place the jam in a piping bag fitted with a filling tip. Push the filling tip into the side ofBerliner, along the white rim, and squeeze some jam into the donut. Repeat this for all of the donuts.
Place the granulated sugar into a wide shallow bowl and mix in just a touch of cinnamon. Place a donut on the sugar, scoop some sugar on top of it, and roll it around in the sugar until well coated. Repeat for all remaining donuts.
Place the sugar coated donuts on a wire rack and dust the tops with powdered sugar.

Germknödel (Austrian Yeast Dumplings),Kimberly Killebrew,5,30,"Dessert, Main Course","Austrian, German",30 minutes,30 minutes,NA,NA,NA,4,"Place the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, egg, melted butter and milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. (Whether you're using active dry yeast or instant yeast, both can be added directly to the dough mixture. It's a common misconception that active dry yeast has to be bloomed first.)
Mix the dough until it comes together (add a little more milk if needed) and then continue to knead for about 4 minutes. You should have a soft and pliable dough.
Spray the bowl with some oil, shape the dough into a ball and place it back in the bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set it in a warm place to rise for 60-90 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.
Punch down the dough and place it on a floured work surface.
Divide the dough into 8 roughly equal pieces. If you weigh them they'll be approximately 140 grams/5 ounces each.
Roll the pieces into balls, roll each ball out, and place a couple of tablespoons of powidl in the center.
Fold the sides of the dough in and press them together well to seal them and shape into a ball. Place the ball down, seam side down. Repeat this for all the dumplings. Cover the dumplings with a towel or plastic wrap, leaving room between them to expand, and let them rest in a warm place for another 30-60 minutes until nice and puffy.
Pour the water into a large non-stick saute pan and add 1/4 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. I'm using a 5 quart 12-inch ceramic saute pan that fits 8 Germknödel perfectly.
Place the Germknödel in the pan. Don’t smash them together, they need to have some room to expand. Return the water to a very low simmer.The objective is to gently steam them. Place the lid on the pan. Let the dumplings cook for about 30 minutes.
WARNING: Whatever you do, do NOT open the lid until the dumplings are done or they will collapse. I like to use a pan with a glass lid so I can see what’s going on inside.

Authentic German Sauerbraten,Kimberly Killebrew,4.98,292,Main Course,German,30 minutes,NA,NA,30 minutes,6 servings,5,"Prepare the Marinade: Place all of the veggies and herbs in a heavy non-reactive stock pot or enameled Dutch oven along with the garlic, juniper berries, whole cloves, bay leaves, salt, sugar and peppercorns. Add the red wine, red wine vinegar and water.
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down completely. 
Marinate the Meat: Nestle the roast in the vegetable marinade and place the lid on the pot.
Let it marinate in the fridge for at least 4 days, preferably 7. (Traditionally, the marinating time is as long as 2 weeks!) Unless the meat is completely submerged under the liquid, turn the roast over once every day.
Remove the roast, pat it dry with paper towels, and strain the liquid from the vegetables. Reserve the liquid and the vegetables. 

Cook the Roast: Rinse the pot out and heat a tablespoon or two of oil in it over high heat. Generously brown the roast on all sides. Remove the roast and set aside. If using bacon, cook the bacon until done. 
Leave about 2 tablespoons of oil/fat in the pot. Place the strained vegetables in the pot (with the bacon if using) and cook for 5-7 minutes. Stir in the flour, cooking the mixture for a minute or two to eliminate the flour flavor. Add the liquid that you strained from the vegetable marinade, bring it to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
Add the raisins, honey and crushed ginger snaps. Return the roast to the pot.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 2-4 hours or until the meat is very tender. Cooking time will vary depending on the type of roast and how long the roast marinated. Aim for an internal temperature of 190-200 F to ensure the temp is high enough to break down connective tissues for a fork-tender result.
(Note: The longer you let the roast marinate the faster it will cook because the meat will be more tender from the start. So check on your roast periodically for doneness.)
When the roast is done, remove and transfer it to a plate, tent it to keep warm, and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing. 
Prepare the Gravy: While the roast is resting, strain the gravy and return the gravy to the pot. Taste and more sugar, salt and pepper as desired. If you want your gravy thicker, make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the gravy. (Note: The balance of sour to sweet is a matter of personal taste – adjust the flavor according to your preference. If the flavor is too strong for you, you can dilute it with a little water or broth.)
Spoon the gravy over the sliced Sauerbraten and serve immediately.

With the dough hook attached, mix the dough until it comes together (add a little more milk if needed) and then continue to knead for about 4 minutes. You should have a soft and pliable dough.
Spray the bowl with some oil, shape the dough into a ball and place it in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set it in a warm place to rise for 60-90 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.
Punch down the dough. Place it on a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 8 roughly equal pieces. I often weigh the pieces, added a little more dough from the larger ones to the smaller ones just because I like them to be as uniform in size as possible (they'll be approximately 140grams/5 ounces each).
Shape the dough into individual balls, squeezing the seams together at the bottom and then lay the balls on the lightly floured work surface, seam side down, and spread apart to give them room to expand.
Cover with a kitchen towel and let them rise in a warm place for another 30-60 minutes or until puffy.
Place the milk, butter and sugar in a large non-stick pan with high sides (non-stick is a must). I use a 5 quart 12-inch ceramic saute pan that fits 8 Dampfnudeln perfectly. Heat the milk to a low simmer, stirring until the butter and sugar is melted.
Place the Dampfnudeln in the pan. Don't smash them together, they need to have some room to expand. Return the milk to a very low simmer. Dampfnudeln are cooked not by boiling but by steaming them.Place the lid on the pan. Let the dumplings cook for about 30 minutes.
Whatever you do, do NOT open the lid while the dumplings are cooking. The release of the built up steam and introduction to cooler air will cause the dumplings to collapse. I like to use a pan with a glass lid so I can see what's going on inside.
After about 30 minutes the dumplings will have risen beautifully and will be cooked through. Their interiors will be soft and fluffy.
At this point the final step is to remove the lid, increase the heat just a little, and cook for just a few minutes longer allow any remaining liquid to evaporate while simultaneously allowing the bottom of the dumplings to brown. Just be careful not to let them burn.

The easiest way to do this – and to do it quickly – is to use a mandoline slicer. Quarter the slices. Remove any seeds.
Add the citrus to a medium-sized pot with the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a steady simmer and simmer for one our until the citrus is very soft. Give it an occasional stir.
Add the sugar and return to a full boil. Reduce to a steady simmer and simmer for another 20-30 minutes or until a candy thermometer reaches 220-225 degrees F.
If you'd rather not get a candy thermometer you can use the ""plate test."" Simply place a plate in the freezer for a few minutes and then place a dab of marmalade on the cold plate. Tilt the plate to see if the marmalade is set. If it's too runny, it's not ready – continue simmering. If it congeals into a soft gel and only moves just a little, it's ready.
Let the marmalade sit for 2-3 minutes, then skim the foam off the top of the marmalade and discard. Letting it sit will evenly distribute the citrus pieces so they don't float to the top when you place the mixture in your jars.
Pour the marmalade into hot, sterilized jars leaving 1/4 inch headspace from the top. You can either store your jars in the fridge for up to a few months or you can store them even longer by canning them. To can them, process them for 5 minutes in a water bath canner.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter. It's fine if a few small lumps remain.
Place a little butter or oil into each of the wells of the pan. (For the best flavor use butter.) Once hot (medium-low to medium heat) pour the batter into each well, filling them nearly full. I always recommend doing a test run with one aebleskiver first to ensure the correct temperature of the pan. 
Let the batter cook until it begins to bubble around the edges, then use a skewer to push against the side of each well and gently turn the aebleskiver 90degrees. As you do this the batter will spill into the bottom of the well. Wait for the batter to start bubbling around the edges again and then give them another 90 degree turn. Repeat this process, giving the aebleskiver a third turn. Now give the aebleskiver the fourth and final turn to complete the full sphere.

Run the berries and liquid through a food mill (this is optional if you wish to remove the seeds).
Weigh how much of berry pulp you have and then weigh an equal amount of sugar. Place the berry pulp and the sugar back in the pot. Bring it to boil, stirring constantly to prevent scorching, until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to boil for another 5-10 minutes and then do a wrinkle test to check if the jelly has set. You do this by placing a plate in the freezer for several minutes, then spoon a tiny bit of jelly onto the chilled plate and wait a couple of minutes. Push against the jelly mixture with your finger. If it wrinkles when you push it the jelly is set and ready. If it doesn't let the jelly mixture boil for a few more minutes before testing it again.

BEST Peanut Butter Cake,Kimberly Killebrew,4.93,203,Dessert,American,30 minutes,30 minutes,NA,NA,NA,4,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, add the peanut butter, oil, and brown sugar. Beat until combined and creamy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and beat just until combined.
Alternately add the flour and buttermilk to the wet mixture, beating just until combined. Be careful not to over-beat or the cake will be dense and dry. A few small lumps of flour is fine.
Grease a 9X3 inch round baking pan (I use Magic Line pans). Pour the batter into the pan.
Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out moist (not wet with batter but moist. If the toothpick is dry, the cake is over-baked and will be dry). Let the cake sit in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.
To Make the Frosting: In the meantime place the peanut butter and butter in a large mixing bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy. Add the powdered sugar one cup at a time, continuing to beat. Add the heavy cream until you reach a spreadable consistency. (Note: This is a fairly stiff frosting.)

Authentic Hutzelbrot (German Dried Fruit & Nut Bread),Kimberly Killebrew,4.94,16,"Dessert, Snack",German,30 minutes,NA,NA,30 minutes,48 slices (approx.),10,"Place the dried fruits (except for the raisins) in a pot and pour the water over them. Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit for at least 3 hours. Pour them into a colander over a bowl to collect all of the liquid. Let it strain for a sufficient amount of time to ensure as much of the liquid is drained out as possible. Reserve the fruit liquid, you’ll need it later. (See NOTE) 
While the dried fruits are cooling, place the raisins in a bowl and stir in the rum so the raisins soak it all up.
Toast the whole almonds and hazelnuts in the oven until fragrant (be careful not so scorch them) and once cooled chop them very coarsely (basically just in half). Coarsely chop the drained dried fruits.
Heat 1 1/4 cups of the reserved fruit water (keep the rest for later) until just lukewarm. Stir the yeast into it along with a couple teaspoons of the sugar. Let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes until very frothy.
While the yeast mixture is sitting, add the flours, sugar, salt, ground anise seed and cinnamon to the bowl of a stand mixer and stir to combine. Make a well in the center and pour the yeast mixture in. Using the dough hook, knead the mixture until it comes together and then knead for about 6 minutes. The dough will be very firm. Lightly spray the bowl and put the dough ball back in. Loosely cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. The dough will not rise much, it will just get slightly puffy.
Add the chopped dried fruits, raisins, candied lemon and orange peels, chopped toasted nuts and lemon zest to the dough. Using the dough hook, knead the mixture until it is thoroughly combined. The fruits will become mushier and incorporate into the dough and depending on how much liquid was drained out of the dried fruits, the dough may be very wet. Continue adding a little flour at a time until the dough is manageable. You do NOT want it to become stiff and dry, it needs to remain soft and moist but not too wet. You want to reduce the moisture just until the dough is manageable enough to turn out onto a work surface where you will continue to add a little more flour as needed.
Turn the dough out onto a generously floured work surface. Use your hands to knead the dough to make sure all the ingredients are evenly incorporated, adding more flour as needed until you’ve got a round dough ball that is soft and malleable but not sticky on the outside.
Place the dough ball into a lightly sprayed large bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let it rest at room temperature for about 2 hours. It will not rise very much, it will just become a little puffy. Punch it down in the center, cover with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator overnight. This will improve the flavor of the yeast dough and also enable to flavors of the fruits and spices to develop and fully penetrate the dough.
NOTE: If you’re in a hurry, you can skip the overnight refrigeration step (though we recommend it). After letting the dough rest at room temp for 2 hours, follow the steps to form the Hutzelbrot loaves, and let them rest for another 60-90 minutes until slightly puffy, brush with the fruit juice and bake as instructed.
The next day, remove the dough from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 4-5 hours. Again, it won’t rise a whole lot but it will become puffier. Cut the dough ball into 4 equal portions (though the dough won’t have risen much, it will be nice and puffy when you cut into it). Don’t make the loaves any larger, you want to ensure the inside is fully baked before the outside burns. 
Form each piece into oval-shaped loaves and place them on a lined baking sheet. NOTE: If you prefer, you can divide them further to make 8 smaller loaves (in which case I recommend forming them into little round loaves) and reduce the baking time.
Place the whole, blanched almonds on top in the traditional manner (see pictures). Loosely lay some plastic wrap over the top and let the loaves rest in a warm place for 60-90 minutes until just slightly puffy.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Brush each loaf all over with the reserved fruit juice, saving half of it for later. Bake the loaves on the middle rack for about an hour until very dark brown but not burnt. Pick one up with a dish towel and knock on the bottom to see if it sounds fairly hollow.
Remove the loaves from the oven and, while still hot, poke them all over with a toothpick and brush them with the remaining fruit juice. Let them cool completely and then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and then foil to let them ""ripen"" for a few days (traditionally they're left to ripen in a cool place for 2 weeks) before eating. That will ensure the best flavor and texture. Note, if you're letting them age for more than a few days you can transfer them to the fridge but they will get hard in the cold temperature. You can microwave the slices for a few seconds to soften them up.

Apple Strudel (Apfelstrudel),Kimberly Killebrew,5,66,Dessert,"Austrian, German",30 minutes,30 minutes,NA,NA,NA,5,"Place the raisins in a bowl and toss with the rum. Let soak for at least an hour or up to overnight. Drain.
To make the filling:
Combine the sugar and cinnamon. Place the apples, raisins, walnuts, lemon juice, and cinnamon sugar in a large bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.
To make the strudel dough:
In a food processor add the flour and salt, and pulse to combine. Add the water, oil, and lemon juice/vinegar (the acid helps relax the gluten making the pastry dough more elastic) and, if using, the egg. Pulse until the dough comes together. Do not over-knead. Alternatively you can do this in a stand mixer or by hand.
 Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, slam it down a few times to encourage the gluten development, and knead for a couple of minutes. If the dough is too sticky add a little more flour. If it is too dry add a little more water. Form the dough into a ball.
Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turn the ball around in the bowl to lightly coat the ball in oil, then cover with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Do not rush this process, the gluten in the flour need time to relax so that it becomes more elastic. The dough is not going to rise during this time since there is no yeast in it, but it's going to relax and soften.
Preheat the oven to 375 F(190 C). Line a baking sheet.
Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll the dough out to a diameter of 12-15 inches. On a clean work surface, spread out an extra large, clean, smooth dish towel or a tablecloth and very lightly flour it. Transfer the dough onto the cloth, smoothing any wrinkles in the cloth, and brush with 1/3 of the butter (this will help moisten the dough to help prevent it from ripping when we stretch it).
Very gently lift and stretch the dough from the center to the outside, working your way around the perimeter of the dough to form a large rectangular, using your knuckles at first to move from center to the outer perimeter (be sure to remove any jewelry that could get caught on the dough).
Continue this process, gently pulling and stretching any thicker areas of dough. The dough is thin enough when it starts to look translucent and you can see the pattern of the cloth underneath it. The thinner the dough, the flakier the pastry. Trim off the thick band of dough around the pastry sheet, leaving a thin pastry sheet that's about the size of your standard baking sheet (18×26 in).
Brush half of the remaining butter over the pastry sheet. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over half of the pastry sheet, leaving an inch around the edges. Spread the apple mixture over the breadcrumbs.

Pandoro (Italian Christmas Cake),Kimberly Killebrew,5,31,"Dessert, Tea",Italian,20 minutes,NA,NA,20 minutes,NA,3,"Note: If you can't find the classic star-shaped pandoro mold, you can use a 9-cup capacity Bundt or pound cake pan.
To make the starter dough: 
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the lukewarm water and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until nice and frothy. Place the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and add the yeast mixture. Using the dough hook, knead the ingredients until they come together. The dough will be smooth but firm and stiff.
Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly greased bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours or until nearly doubled in size.
Punch it down, form it into a ball, place it back in the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge to sit overnight. **Remove the dough from the fridge the next day 2 hours before you're ready to proceed with making the pandoro.
The next day dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in the lukewarm milk and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until nice and frothy.
Place the flour, sugar, and yeast mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix it together with spoon or with the dough hook. Using the dough hook, add the eggs one at a time, kneading between additions. The mixture will come together into a rich yellow dough.
Add the starter dough to the stand mixer. Knead the two doughs together for about 5 minutes. Add the butter, lemon zest, vanilla, and honey and knead for about 10minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. The dough should be very smooth and elastic but not overly sticky. If it's too sticky add a little more flour.
Form the dough into a ball, lightly spray the bowl, and place the dough back in, loosely covered with plastic wrap, to rise in a warm place for about 3 hours or until nearly tripled in size. Punch the dough down.
Generously butter a pandoro mold pan getting into all the cracks and crevices. You will need a 9-cup pandoro mold (about 2 liter capacity).
Next add some flour to the pan and shake it to thoroughly coat it with flour, shaking out the excess flour. Again, be sure to get into all the cracks and crevices so that your pandoro doesn't stick to the pan.
Place the dough into the prepared pandoro mold. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until the dough has risen to about an inch or so above the top of the mold.
In the meantime preheat the oven to 325 F.
Bake the pandoro on the middle rack for 30 minutes.
Reduce the temperature to 300 F and bake for another 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 195 F and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Be careful not to over-bake or your pandoro will be very dry.
During the baking process if the pandoro begins to brown too quickly cover it with aluminum foil.
Let the pandoro cool in the mold on a wire rack for 15 minutes and then carefully remove the pandoro from the mold.
Cut a thin layer off the base so it will sit flat on a serving plate.
To serve the pandoro, once it is cool you can either dust the whole bread with powdered sugar and cut it vertically into slices (traditional). Or for a more interesting look you can slice the pandoro in thick horizontal slices, then rotate the slices. You can then either dust the pandoro with powdered sugar or you can layer each of the horizontal slices with custard, cream, or a filling of choice.",16,For the Starter Dough:,1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon lukewarm water,1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast,1 teaspoon sugar,3/4 cup all-purpose flour,1/2 teaspoon salt,For the Main Dough:,1/2 cup lukewarm whole milk,2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast,2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour,1/2 cup sugar,4 large egg yolks,"12 tablespoons unsalted butter , softened at room temp",2 tablespoons honey,"2 tablespoons vanilla bean paste (is thicker, has vanilla flecks, and a more intense flavor than vanilla extract but you can substitute 2 TEAspoons of extract if you wish)",zest of one lemon,Daring Gourmet,https://www.daringgourmet.com/pandoro-recipe/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Authentic Stollen (German Christmas Bread),Kimberly Killebrew,5,610,Dessert,German,NA,40 minutes,NA,40 minutes,24 servings,8,"Place the raisins, candied citrus peel and almonds in a medium bowl and pour the rum over it. Stir to combine. Set aside and let the fruit mixture soak in the rum while the dough rises.
Stir the yeast and 2 tablespoons of the sugar into the lukewarm milk and let sit in a warm place for 10-15 minutes until very frothy.
Place the flour, remaining sugar, egg, egg yolks, butter, vanilla extract, lemon zest, salt, cardamom, mace and cinnamon in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the yeast/milk mixture. Use a spoon to stir the mixture until it comes together. Knead the dough on the bread setting for 7-8 minutes. Remove the dough ball, lightly spray the bowl with a little oil, return the dough ball, cover loosely with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place or lightly warmed oven (just barely warm), to rise until nearly doubled in size, at least 1 hour (likely closer to 2 hours depending on the temperature of the environment).
Punch down the dough and add the soaked fruit/nut mixture to the dough (it should have absorbed all the rum by now but if there is excess liquid, pour it out before adding the mixture to the dough). Using the dough hook, knead the fruit/nut mixture into the dough until combined. If the dough is too wet to handle, add a little bit of flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. 
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut it in two equal halves. Press or roll each piece into an oval to about 1 inch thickness. Roll each piece of marzipan into a log the length of the oval. Press the marzipan gently into the middle of the dough. Fold the left side of the dough over to cover the marzipan, then fold right side over on top of the left side so that the edge of it sits just left of the middle of the stollen (see pics). In other words, don’t fold the right side all the way over to the left edge of the stollen. Pinch and tuck the top and bottom ends of the stollen to cover the marzipan. Use the bottom edge of your hand to press down along the length of the stollen towards the right of the center to create a divot and characteristic hump (see pics). Place the stollen on a lined baking sheet. Cover the stollen loosely with plastic wrap and let them rest in a warm place or lightly warmed oven for 40-60 minutes until puffy. At that point you can pick off any raisins that are sticking out of the dough (they will burn during baking). 
Towards the end of the last rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake the stollen for 30-40 minutes or until golden. You can use an instant read thermometer to aim for an internal temperature of 190 degrees F. Let the Stollen sit for 5 minutes, then use a toothpick to poke holes all over the stollen (this will allow the butter to seep in), then generously brush the stollen with the melted butter while the stollen are still warm. Immediately sprinkle with a generous amount of powdered sugar, rubbing it into the creases and down the sides. Let the stollen cool completely. You may want to give it another dusting of powdered sugar once cooled.
The stollen can be sliced and eaten now or wrapped tightly (wrap in plastic wrap then foil) and left to ""ripen"" in a cool place for 2 weeks. The liquid from the dried fruits will further penetrate the dough for more flavor and moisture. Stollen can also be frozen for longer storage.

Traditional Panettone Recipe,Kimberly Killebrew,4.98,77,"Breakfast, Brunch, Dessert",Italian,NA,45 minutes,NA,45 minutes,10 servings,6,"For the Starter: Stir the yeast into the lukewarm water and let it sit for about 10 minutes until frothy. Place the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment (if your bowl is too large for that small of quantity knead it by hand). Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and knead for 5 minutes if using the stand mixer and about 10 minutes if kneading by hand. Shape the dough into a ball and put it in a very lightly greased bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size. Punch it down, cover with plastic wrap again and refrigerate it overnight.
The next day take it out and let it come to room temperature before proceeding (this will take about 2 hours). Let it rise until nearly doubled in size.
To Prepare the Fruit Mixture: Place the raisins, candied lemon peel, candied orange peel, lemon and orange zest in a small bowl and pour 1/4 cup of hot water over them. Stir, cover and let soak for at least 2 hours or overnight. Drain any excess liquid before adding it to the panettone dough. Properly draining it is critical to preventing a wet dough.
To Prepare the Panettone: Place the flour, yeast, salt and sugar in the stand mixer and stir to combine. Attach the dough hook attachment. Add the egg yolks and milk and mix until it comes all comes together. Punch down the starter dough and add it to the stand mixer. Knead it for 5 minutes, regularly scraping down the sides.
Add the softened butter, vanilla and honey and knead for another 10 minutes (yes, that's 10 minutes). The mixture should be totally smooth and elastic but not overly sticky. Add the fruit mixture and knead until fully incorporated. If the dough is too wet add a little extra flour.
Scrape the dough down, cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature until nearly tripled in size, about 3 hours.
Towards the end of this final rise preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (325 if using convection) and place the rack in the lower third of the oven.
Gently punch down the dough, form it into a ball and place it in a buttered panettone mold (7.3"" x 4.25"", click link for reference). Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise for about another 2 hours or until doubled in size. It should be risen to about 1 inch or so higher than the rim of the mold.
Once the panettone is risen, if you'd like a glossy top brush the top of the panettone with some egg wash (a lightly beaten egg).
Use a very sharp knife (I use a razor blade) and score an ""x"" across the entire top of the panettone. Place about a tablespoon chunk of butter in the center.
Bake the panettone for 40-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (if the top is browning too quickly place foil over it). Be careful not to over-bake or the panettone will be very dry.
Recommended: For best accuracy and to prevent under or over-baking use an instant read thermometer. The panettone is done when the internal temperature reaches between 190 and 195 degrees F.
Remove the panettone from the oven and immediately stick two wooden skewers through the bottom of it and hang it upside down inside of a large, deep pot or somewhere where it can hang as it cools. This will prevent the top of the panettone from collapsing in on itself.
Once cool, slice the panettone vertically in slices. Enjoy at room temp or toasted. See blog post for serving recommendations.

Homemade Breakfast Sausage Recipe (Links or Patties),Kimberly Killebrew,4.94,31,Breakfast,American,30 minutes,NA,NA,30 minutes,60 sausages,4,"Cut the pork into 1/2 inch chunks and freeze them for about 45 minutes to get them to a temperature of 32 degrees F (0 celsius). Grind the pork through a 1/4 inch (6mm) die. Grind the meat quickly into the bowl of a stand mixer (ideally have the bowl set atop an ice bath to keep the meat cold) and then grind it all a second time. Chill the meat in the refrigerator while you assemble the spice mixture.
In a bowl combine the salt, sage, thyme, ginger, white and black pepper, garlic and nutmeg. 
Remove the ground meat from the fridge and place it on the stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. (If you have room in your freezer, pre-chill the mixing bowl.) Add the spice mixture and the ice water and the maple syrup if using. Mix it with the paddle for 3-4 minutes until threads begin to appear in the meat (if you take a clump of meat and pull it apart with your fingers you will see tiny threads pulling apart). Chill the mixture in the fridge while you prepare the sausage stuffer. Take a bit of the meat mixture, fry it up, taste it and adjust the seasonings if needed.
If making sausage patties: scoop some of the mixture into your hands and roll it into a ball (about the size of a golf ball or slightly bigger), then press it down into a patty. These can be layered on a cookie sheet with plastic wrap or wax paper between the layers, frozen, and then transferred to a ziplock freezer bag or container.
If making sausage links:
Thread the sausage stuffer with the prepared sheep casings, fill the sausage stuffer with the meat mixture, and fill the casings being careful to avoid air gaps while also not overstuffing the casings. Twist the sausages into links. Use a sausage pricker to prick any air bubbles out of the links. 
Cook the sausages by heating up some oil in a frying pan and frying the sausages on each side for about 3 minutes until browned and done in the middle (internal temperature of 155 degrees F). 
OR you can poach the sausages (do not boil) in lightly salted water until their internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, then let them cool in ice water, wrap them and store in the fridge for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

Pastéis de Nata (Portuguese Custard Tarts),Kimberly Killebrew,4.99,50,Dessert,Portuguese,NA,15 minutes,NA,15 minutes,NA,3,"Make the Custard:
Place the water, sugar, cinnamon and lemon rind in a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer – without stirring – until it reachers 220 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.
Remove from the heat and let it cool for at least 15 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
In a separate medium saucepan scald the milk (heat until up to the boiling point but don't let it boil). Turn off the heat and add the flour and salt to the hot milk and whisk constantly until the mixture is nice and thick. Add the egg yolks and whisk until combined. Whisk in the vanilla extract.
Remove the cinnamon and lemon rind from the syrup. In a thin, steady stream pour the syrup into the egg/flour mixture, whisking constantly. The custard will be very thin, this is normal.
Pour the custard through a fine mesh sieve to strain out any chunky bits.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside until ready to use. You can make this in advance and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
Prepare the Pastry Dough:
On a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry dough out to roughly a 11×14 inch rectangle. Beginning at the short end, roll up the pastry dough, rolling it tightly as you go along. Wrap the pastry roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
Assemble the Tarts:
Preheat the oven to the highest temperature it will go (I heated mine to 525 degrees F). 
Use a pastry cutter or sharp knife to cut the pastry log into about 3/4 inch thick rounds. (Cut a thin layer off each end and discard.)
Use a standard size nonstick muffin pan. Depending on how full you fill the tarts this recipe makes about 16 tarts so you may need a second muffin pan.
Place a pastry round in each tin. Use your thumbs to press the pastry down and up the sides to the very top to fit the mold. 
Pour the prepared custard into each pastry case to about 3/4 of the way full. Don't fill them too full or the custard will overflow onto the rims of the tart crusts. 
Place the pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven.
Depending on the max temperature of your oven, bake for about 14-16 minutes (my oven was set to 525 degrees F). You'll know the tarts are done when the tops are nicely scorched and the filling is set. 
Remove from the oven and let the tarts cool for about 8-10 minutes before removing them. 
Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar and a small pinch of cinnamon if desired.

Cut the peel on each each into 4 or more vertical segments, depending on the size of the fruit. Peel off each segment of rind. (You can remove a little of the white pith, though not necessary. The pith is bitter but the blanching process below will help reduce the bitterness. Note that if you remove the white pith, the thinner the peels are the harder and more leathery they will be when they’re candied.) Slice the peels into 1/4 inch wide strips. (Keep the peeled citrus for eating, cooking, juicing, etc)
Boil the peels in a pot of water for 15 minutes. Drain the peels in a colander, rinse and then drain again. Discard the water from the pot.
Repeat this process one or two more times to reduce the bitter flavor.
Add the 1 cup of fresh water and the sugar to the pot and bring it to a boil. Boil it for a couple of minutes until the sugar is dissolved. Add the citrus peels, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the peels become translucent and the syrup becomes lightly syrupy (on a candy thermometer this will be be approximately soft ball stage or 235-240 F).
Use a slotted spoon to remove a few of the peels at a time and let the excess syrup drip off for a few seconds. Place the hot, wet peels in a bowl of sugar or a ziplock bag with sugar in it and toss/shake to coat.
Spread the candied citrus peels out on a wire rack to cool and dry completely, 1-2 days. *Note: Tossing them in sugar and letting them dry is only necessary if you're storing them at room temp for an extended period of time.

Traditional Figgy Pudding (Christmas Pudding),Kimberly Killebrew,5,236,Dessert,"British, english",25 minutes,NA,NA,25 minutes,NA,4,"Place the raisins, sultanas, currants, almonds, and candied citrus peel in a bowl. Pour the brandy over and stir to combine the mixture. Cover and let sit overnight to allow the brandy to fully penetrate the fruit.
The next day, place the breadcrumbs, flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and spices in a bowl and stir to combine.
In another bowl add the soaked dried fruit mixture, grated apple, black treacle, suet, lemon and orange zest, and egg. Stir to combine.
Add the dry mixture to the fruit mixture and stir to thoroughly combine it. It will be thick and sticky.
Generously butter your 2 liter/3.5 pint pudding mold and scoop the batter into the mold, pressing down and smoothing the top.
Cut a circle out of parchment paper the same diameter as the top of the pudding mold. Lightly butter the paper and place it, butter side down, on top of the batter. Next tear off two more pieces of parchment paper large enough to cover the to of the pudding mold and partially down the sides of the mold. If your pudding mold is small and the batter comes to the top of it, fold a pleat in the center of the parchment papers to allow room for expansion as the pudding cooks. Trim off excess paper.
Secure the paper by folding down the sides and tying securely with a string (to make it easier you can secure it first with a rubber band while you're tying it and then remove the rubber band).
Note: If your mold comes with a lid as mine does, I still like to adda layer of parchment paper before securing the lid.
Bring a large pot of water to a very low simmer. Place a folded cloth or trivet on the bottom of the pot to prevent the pudding mold from coming in direct contact with the pot in order to prevent scorching.
Lower the pudding mold down into the water on top of the folded cloth. The water level should come up to the halfway point of the pudding mold. Cover the pot with the lid.
Steam the pudding over very low heat for approximately 8 hours. The water should not be boiling, it should be steaming. Check periodically to ensure the water level is still at the halfway point and add more water as needed.
The longer the pudding steams the darker in color it will become.
When the pudding is done steaming, carefully lift out the pudding mold and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then invert the pudding on a plate. Let it sit until the pudding slides out onto the plate. Let the pudding cool completely.
To store, remove the parchment paper and wrap the pudding with clean parchment paper followed by aluminum foil. Wrap tightly. Store it in a cool, dark place, preferably a basement. If you do not have a cool, dark environment in your home you can keep it in the fridge but make sure it is tightly wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap and some aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out. Follow these same guidelines along with placing the pudding in a ziplock freezer bag to freeze the pudding.
When you're ready to serve the pudding you will need to reheat it either by re-steaming it for 30-60 minutes or until heated through or you can also microwave it in a microwave safe container to keep the moisture in.
You can light the pudding on fire just before serving (see blog post section on how to light a pudding) and then serve with Hard Sauce (i.e., brandy butter) or powdered sugar, whipped cream, English Custard, ice cream, or lemon sauce.

Homemade Mozartkugeln,Kimberly Killebrew,5,2,Dessert,"Austrian, German",45 minutes,NA,NA,45 minutes,NA,3,"The size for each ingredient will depend on how large/small you want your Mozartkugeln so these are general guidelines. *See step-by-step photos in blog post for visual reference.
Pinch of some of the pistachio marzipan and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hands. Set aside. Scoop out some of the nougat and roll it into a larger ball than the pistachio marzipan, then flatten it into a disk. Set aside. Pinch off some of the almond marzipan and roll it into a larger ball than the nougat, then flatten it into a disk.
Take the pistachio marzipan ball and set it on the disk of nougat. Close the nougat around the pistachio marzipan and roll it into a ball. Now set the pistachio-enclosed nougat ball onto the disk of marzipan. Close the marzipan around the nougat ball to fully enclose it and then roll it into a ball in the palms of your hands.
If you're making round Mozartkugeln which will require impaling them on a skewer for dipping into the chocolate, I recommend chilling the prepared balls for at least an hour before dipping them in chocolate. This will firm up the kugeln help prevent them from sliding down the skewer while you're waiting for the chocolate to set because the ingredients are too soft and the weight of the kugeln are too heavy. If you're not making round kugeln and plan on dipping and setting them on a flat surface to dry then there's no need to chill them first.
Dip the kugeln in the melted chocolate to thoroughly and evenly coat them, letting the excess chocolate drip off.
If using skewers stick the bottom ends of the skewers into some styrofoam to keep them upright while the kugeln are drying, making sure the kugeln don't touch each other. I recommend placing them in the fridge where they will dry more quickly which will help prevent them from sliding down the skewer over time.
If you're not using skewers, place the chocolate dipped skewers onto a lined cookie sheet or other surface until set.
To make these all the fancier you can wrap them individually with regular or gold foil.
These will keep for a couple of months stored in the fridge in an airtight container (even longer if the marzipan is made with liquid sweetener instead of egg white).
Note: This will make about 18 Mozartkugeln and you'll have some pistachio marzipan and nougat left over.

Combine the flours, nut meal, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, Lebkuchengewürz, cinnamon and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the candied orange peel. Stir the warm honey syrup and the milk into the flour and stir to combine until a stiff dough forms. Start will less milk and add more as needed if the dough is too dry. Cover and let sit overnight at room temperature or up to 24 hours to allow the flavors time to mature.
Preheat the oven to 350 F (175 C).
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into logs about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place the logs about 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. Gently press to slightly flatten the logs. Bake for 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes and then, while the gingerbread is still warm, slice each log at a diagonal into 1 to 1 1/2 inch wide pieces.

To Make the Glaze:
Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and, using a candy thermometer, simmer until the mixture reaches 234 F (113 C). If you don't get it fully up to this temperature the glaze will not set and will be wet and sticky. If the temperature far exceeds 234 F the glaze will be dry and crumbly. Get it as close to 234 F as possible (a little over is better than a little under).
Once the mixture reaches 234 F remove it from the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder and vanilla extract.
Place the Magenbrot in a large mixing bowl and immediately pour over the hot glaze, stirring to evenly coat the Magenbrot. Place the wet Magenbrot on a lined baking sheet in a single layer so they are not touching each other and let them dry completely.

Place the dry ingredients in a food processor and pulse until blended. Add the cold butter and lard and pulse a few more times until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the apple cider vinegar and water a little at a time, pulsing between additions, until the mixture comes together. Be careful NOT to over-mix the pastry or it will be tough and not flaky.
Form the dough into a ball, flatten into a 1-inch thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. (The pastry can be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for up to 3 months.)
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Roll out the chilled pastry dough. It's easiest to roll it out on to plastic wrap and then transfer it to the tart pan. Roll the pastry dough out so that the diameter is slightly larger than the tart pan. You will need a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom (also commonly called a quiche pan).

Let it simmer on very low for 40-60 minutes or longer until the sugar is a rich amber color. If you're using a thermometer the temperature should be about 240-250 degrees F.
Note: If your syrup is too thick and stiff you can reheat it, adding a little bit of water. If your syrup is too runny then you need to let the syrup caramelize longer.

In a small saucepan heat the sugar beet syrup and brown sugar until the brown sugar is completely dissolved. Let it cool down a bit.
Pour the syrup mixture into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and add the candied orange peel.
Add the flour mixture and the crushed brown rock sugar. Stir until it starts to come together or if using a stand mixer use the paddle attachment.
Use your hands to knead the mixture together until fully combined, or if using a stand mixer use the paddle attachment. The dough will be soft and pliable and some stickiness is normal (this will subside as the dough rests). If the dough is extremely sticky add a little more flour. If the dough is too dry, add a tiny bit of water.
Form the dough into a flattened 1-inch thick disk, wrap really well in plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a cool place (NOT IN THE FRIDGE) for at least 5 days, preferably longer. Traditionally in Germany the dough would be left to rest for several weeks to develop flavor and to improve the texture. If you find the dough is too hard to roll out, let it rest longer. Even so, prepare to use some muscle to roll it out.
Roll the dough out onto a non-stick surface (I use plastic wrap) to about
1/4 inch or 5mm thickness. If the dough is too sticky knead in a little
more flour.
At this point you can either press the dough into lightly floured wooden
molds, invert the molds and cut out the designs (using the scraps to make more
Printen), or you can cut the dough into small rectangles.
Place the Printen on a lined cookie sheet and place a whole blanched almond
on top (or however you'd like to design them).
At this point you can either bake them immediately or you can glaze them. For the glaze you can either brush the cookies with a little milk
before baking them to create a sheen OR you can bake the cookies first and
brush them while they're still hot with a glaze made from half sugar beet
syrup/half water and let them sit to dry, then store them in an airtight
container (they may still be a little sticky).
Another option is to coat or dip them in chocolate after they're baked and
fully cooled. You can add one or more whole blanched almonds while the
chocolate is still wet or cover them in sliced or slivered almonds.
In an oven preheated to 350 F bake the Printen for 12-18 minutes until lightly browned.

Authentic German Maultaschen,Kimberly Killebrew,5,154,"Entree, Main Dish",German,NA,30 minutes,NA,30 minutes,12 servings,8,"**See the blog post for step-by-step photo instructions**
Place the ground pork and beef, spices and milk powder in the bowl stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add about 1/2 cup crushed ice to the ground meat mixture in the stand mixture. This will keep the meat cold and prevent the fat from melting as the mixture is mixed/emulsified to create the desired texture.
Mix the meat on low-medium speed for a few minutes (be careful not to
over-mix) until the mixture is emulsified. Meaning if you take a clump of
meat and pull it apart with your fingers you should see tiny threads pulling
apart. Set the meat mixture aside until ready to use.
Note: If you're using pre-ground store-bought beef and pork it may not
emulsify properly because of a lower fat content, in which case don't worry
about it and just move on to the next step.
Freezing the Meat Mixture: You can use the meat mixture immediately or you can freeze it so you can have it on hand for convenience to save time when you're ready to make
another batch of Maultaschen.

Boil the spinach for 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water, thoroughly squeeze out the water and very finally chop it. Set aside.
In a frying pan, heat the butter and saute the onion until soft and translucent, 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and parsley and cook for another minute ortwo. Let the mixture cool down so it's not super hot.
Put the meat mixture in a large bowl along with the
onion/parsley mixture, the chopped spinach, prepared breadcrumbs, spices and
eggs. Use a stand mixer or your hands to thoroughly combine the mixture.
NOTE: If you prefer an even finer texture you can
run about one third or so of this mixture through the blender and then stir it
back in to the rest of the mixture.
For the dough you can either use prepared sheets of pasta dough or you can
use a shortcut: Wonton wrappers. Wonton wrappers are just basic
pasta dough (flour, eggs, water) and they're already pre-cut into just the
right sized squares which makes them super convenient. And they're vastly cheaper than buying pre-made sheets of fresh pasta.
Place a small spoonful of Maultaschen filling on a square of
fresh pasta dough (about 3 1/2 x 3 1/2) leaving about 1/4 inch of space from the
edges. Brush the edges with the egg, place another pasta square on top
and press down with your fingers to seal.
To ensure the edges are sealed tightly you can either use a
fork to press the edges together or use a fluted pastry/pasta cutter wheel
to make pretty edges.
How to Freeze Maultaschen: For convenience you can
freeze the Maultaschen at this point. Lay them out in a single layer on a
lined cookie sheet and freeze them. Once frozen remove them and put them
in an airtight container or ziplock bag and freeze for up to 3 months.
To cook the Maultaschen: Bring a large pot of lightly
salted water to a low boil. Working in batches so as to not overcrowd,
place the Maultaschen in the pot and keep the water at a very gentle simmer. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.
Remove the Maultaschen with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a colander
to drain.
To serve: The most traditional way Maultaschen in der Brühe which is warming the Maultaschen in a rich clear broth (usually beef broth) and serving it as a soup.

Wonton Soup,Kimberly Killebrew,5,75,Soup,"Asian, Chinese",35 minutes,20 minutes,NA,55 minutes,6 servings,4,"To make the wontons:
Combine all the wonton ingredients (except for the wrappers) in a large bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the mixture, breaking down the pieces of shrimp until you get small chunks. Continue mashing until you get a smooth texture but not to the point where it’s a paste.
Keep the wontons in the package so they don’t dry out or place a slightly moist towel over them. 
Place a wonton wrapper in the palm of your hand and spoon about 1/2 tablespoon of filling onto the center of each one. Have a bowl of water handy. Dip your other finger in the water and trace around all sides of the wrapper to moisten them. You make can fold the wontons several ways according to your personal preference: Make a simple triangle by folding one corner over the other and pinching to seal the edges; for a little fancier design pull each corner of the triangle down so they overlap and press to seal (resembling a nurse’s cap); or place the wonton in the palm of your hand with the filling in it, wet the edges and draw all the edges together and twist to seal (resembling a drawstring money bag). Repeat the process for the remaining wontons. SEE NOTE about freezing them.
To make the soup: Heat the oil in a stock pot and fry the garlic and ginger for 1-2 minutes until soft, then add the chicken broth, tamari, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and salt. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the carrots and cabbage and simmer for another 5 minutes. Add the wontons, yellow miso paste and green onions and simmer for another 5 minutes (6-8 minutes if using frozen wontons). Add salt to taste.

If it's too dry and crumbly it needs to be pulsed a bit longer. (If using any add-ins, stir them in at this point.)
Pour the mixture into the greased baking pan. Use your fingers and hands to firmly press down the mixture. Note: If the mixture is too dry to work with, including pricking with a fork (see below), then it was not pulsed long enough in the food processor.
Prick the shortbread with the tines of a fork, creating rows. You can also like run a knife between each row of fork tines to make cutting the shortbread easier after it's baked. Another option is to prick the shortbread with a fork immediately after it is done baking while it is still warm; this way the holes will be more pronounced as they have a tendency to close during baking.
Place the shortbread on the middle rack and bake for 30-35 minutes or until light golden and firm. Remove from the oven and sprinkle lightly with caster sugar or granulated sugar. Let cool. Cut and serve.

DIY Smoked Neck Bones & Ham Hocks,Kimberly Killebrew,4.98,43,Ingredient,American,10 minutes,NA,NA,10 minutes,NA,5,"Make the brine by placing all the ingredients, except for the neck bones, in a large bowl and stirring until the salt and sugar are dissolved.
Place the neck bones in a stainless steel or food grade plastic bucket/container with a lid, or divide between 2 gallon ziplock bags, and pour the brine over the neck bones. Cover with lid or close the ziplock bags and place the latter in a large dish to catch any leakage. Make sure the neck bones are covered in the brine. Refrigerate for 7 days, flipping the ziplock bags over each day to ensure even distribution of the brine.
After 7 days rinse off the neck bones and place them on a wire rack on a cookie sheet and refrigerate them uncovered for another 24 hours. This will help the smoke to better adhere to the neck bones.
Set your smoker to 200 degrees F and place the neck bones or ham hocks on the smoking grates, making sure they're not touching each other. Smoke the neck bones until they've reached an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, adding a handful of wood chips a couple of different times throughout the process. Smoking time will vary depending on the size of the neck bones but you can figure on about 2 hours.
Once done, wrap the neck bones and freeze them for long-term storage or refrigerate if you plan on using them within a week.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SMOKER: You can create a makeshift smoker in your oven.

How To Make Fruit Leather,Kimberly Killebrew,4.75,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Place the fruit in a pot (if using ground spices, add them too). If the fruit is really juicy, like plums, apples, peaches, etc, then you hardly have to add any water, just barely enough to keep the bottom from scorching. So just eyeball it, add maybe 1/4 cup of water or so. Check on your fruit as it is stewing to make sure it isn't scorching. If it looks like it needs a little more water, add more. Cover and stew the fruit for 5-10 minutes or until softened.
Puree the fruit until smooth. You can transfer it to a countertop blender or use an immersion blender. Pour the pureed fruit onto lined cookies sheets (either silicone or parchment paper). Spread it out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch or slightly less.
Heat the oven 140°F. To speed up the process you can turn on the convection setting if you have one. It typically takes 8-12 hours to dry out. You'll know your fruit leather is done when the surface is smooth and no longer sticky. (Note: You can dehydrate the fruit leather in either a conventional oven or in a food dehydrator, whichever you prefer. I have a dehydrator but prefer to use the oven for this. It's super simple spreading it out on two cookies sheets and placing them in the oven.
Slice the fruit leather into strips. (You can store the fruit leather either as one large strip and slice it later or store it in strips. Note: If you're using parchment paper the fruit leather is easiest to remove while it's still slightly warm to prevent it from sticking to paper.)
