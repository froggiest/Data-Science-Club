Whole Wheat Digestive Cookies,Madhuram,4, 4 ,American,Prep Time 15 minutes mins,Cook Time 15 minutes mins,Total Time 30 minutes mins,45 Cookies,8,"In a large mixing bowl sift all the dry ingredients except oats and sugar.  Stir in the oats.
Take out the butter from the refrigerator, cut up into small pieces and add it to the flour mixture.  Using a pastry blender further cut the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  If you don't have a pastry blender you can do this with your fingers or fork too, but it's more work.
Stir in the sugar and add milk little by little to form a soft dough.  Knead until smooth.
Press the dough into disk, wrap in plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for 30 minutes.  Set the kitchen timer for 15 minutes.  When the timer goes off start preheating the oven at 375F for 15 minutes.  So by the time the oven preheats it will be 30 minutes and you can start working on the cookie dough.  Also butter 2 cookie sheets.
Lightly flour the surface.  Roll out the dough into ¼ inch thickness.  Use a cookie cutter to cut out the cookies.  Gather the dough scraps, re-roll and continue the same procedure until all the dough is used.
The cookies tend to stick to the floor, so use a spatula to lift and transfer the cookies to the baking sheets.  Place them 1 inch apart.  Prick all over with a fork.
The baking time depends on the thickness of the cookies and the material of the baking sheet.  Note that cookies baked on a dark-colored non stick baking sheet tend to bake faster and if not alert the bottom will get burnt.  My second batch cookies were thinner than the first batch.

In a large bowl, beat the peanut butter, margarine and sugars with an electric mixer until well combined.  Add the Ener-G mixture and vanilla extract and beat it well again.
Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and stir by hand to incorporate it into the dough.  Alternatively you can use the electric mixer at low speed to do this.  Since I have used whole wheat pastry flour I did it by hand itself because I did not want it develop too much gluten.
This cookie dough is dry and crumbly unlike the usual cookie doughs.  You will have to use your hands to mix it well.  About halfway through mixing, add the chocolate chips and stir until just blended.
The way the dough ends up depends upon the type of peanut butter used.  So do as I did.  Test bake 2 cookies and decide what you have to do.  Shape the dough into balls and place at least an inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten each one a little with the palm of your hand, so they're more like little patties.  I pinched small pieces of dough and rolled between my palms; dampened my fingers with little water to enable easy flattening.  The patties were not smooth but had a couple of cracks.  That's fine.
Bake it for about 11-12 minutes, until just set.  I baked the first 2 cookies for 12 minutes and saw that the bottom had started turning dark brown.  Other than that I did not face any other problem with the dough being crumbly.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and cool it on a wire rack for 5 minutes so it will continue to bake and will set completely.

Once it is a bit hard and looks like it can be rolled, preheat the oven at 375C/190C.
Roll out the dough keeping it in between two wax/parchment papers to work easily.  
Instead of using a rolling pin which might not work that well in rolling out the dough uniformly especially if it is a thin rolling pin, I use a flat surfaced utensil to flatten the dough by pressing it and moving it in circles on top of the parchment paper to make a big circle of about ½-inch thickness.
Now use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes and place it on a baking sheet which is lined with parchment paper.
Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until you see a light brown color in the bottom of the cookies.
Once the cookies is done remove the baking sheet from the oven and place it on a cooling rack to cool for about 10 minutes.  Then transfer the cookies from the baking sheet to the rack for it to cool completely and then store it in an air-tight container or decorate as you wish.",7,▢ 1 cup unsalted butter softened,▢ 1 cup sugar,▢ 1 and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 1 and ½ teaspoon Ener-G egg replacer + 3 tablespoons water for 1 egg,▢ 3 cups gluten-free baking mix I used Bob's Red Mill,▢ 1 and ½ teaspoon baking powder,▢ ¼ teaspoon salt,NA,Eggless Cooking,https://www.egglesscooking.com/gluten-free-sugar-cookies-recipe/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bake in preheated oven until cookies are very lightly golden, about 13-16 minutes.  The cookies stay white, so it is not easy to judge if it is fully done or not.  I test baked 3 cookies for 14 minutes and felt it needed more time and so baked the rest of the cookies for 16 minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth.
Keep adding the milk in very small increments because the icing tends to get watery very quickly. Such type of icing will be runny and will not stay on the cookies and will keep oozing.  So if the mixture is too thin, add more sugar and add milk if it's too thick.
If you want to add color to your icing mix you can add in that too. Once the cookies are cool enough and the icing is ready, spread little icing over each cookie, then top with sprinkles while the icing is still wet.

In a small cup, whisk together the Ener-G egg replacer and water; set aside.
Add the vegan butter substitute and sugars (white and brown) in a large bowl and beat until light and creamy.
Add the Ener-G egg replacer mix, corn syrup, and vanilla extract to the creamed butter-sugar mix, and beat well.
To this creamed wet mix, add the dry ingredients listed under Part 2. Mix well with a wooden spoon.
Mix in the chocolate chunks. The cookie dough is ready now.
Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough and place it on the cookie sheet.  As always, I test-baked about 5 cookies to see how well they spread or don't spread so that I don't mess up a huge batch of cookies.  I normally try two things.  Few cookies, I just drop the dough and, for the remaining, flatten it.  The baking test showed that the cookies didn't spread much as it is, so flattening the dough was absolutely necessary.  This may change with the type of fat you use, the consistency of how well it is creamed with the sugar, and the rest of the ingredients.  So always test-bake before trying a huge batch.
Bake the cookies for 15-16 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, place it on a wire cooling rack, and cool completely before storing it in an air-tight container.
Repeat the same process for the rest of the dough.",11,▢ 2 cups vegan butter (Earth Balance),▢ 2 cups granulated sugar,▢ 1 cup brown sugar,▢ 4 teaspoons egg replacer Ener-G,▢ 6 tablespoons water,▢ 4 tablespoons corn syrup,▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,▢ 5 and ½ cups all-purpose flour,Eggless Cooking,https://www.egglesscooking.com/vegan-insomnia-cookies/,▢ 1 teaspoon baking soda,▢ 1 teaspoon salt,▢ 2 cups vegan chocolate chunks,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stir in the Part 3 ingredients and combine everything to form the cookie dough.  At this stage, you may choose to add nuts or chocolate chips, if you choose to use. Remember that this dough is stiff.
Drop tablespoonful of dough for each cookie and lightly flatten it onto a baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes or until the edges around the cookies turn golden brown (See Tips below). These cookies are quite pale compared to usual cookies so watch out for the change of color on the edges.

Turn the cookie dough onto a floured surface, knead for 5 minutes, adding enough remaining flour to form a soft dough without lumps.  I did the kneading in the bowl itself.
I find flouring the counter and rolling the dough a messy job.  Instead, I take a small portion of the dough, place it in between 2 parchment paper sheets, and then roll the dough using a rolling pin or use the flat bottom side of a bowl to evenly spread the dough out.
Roll to ½-inch thickness. Cut into 3x1-in. strips using a knife or pizza cutter. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Prick with a fork. Bake until cookies are golden brown, 20-25 minutes.

Grease and flour (I used cocoa powder to flour the base of the pan because it's a chocolate cake) two 9-inch cake pans.
Sift the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa, and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Make a well.
Add the canola oil.  Then add the hot coffee decoction. Add milk.
Add the pureed tofu.  (Remove the silken tofu from the packet using a spoon, add it to the blender, and puree it to a creamy mixture)
And a few drops of vanilla essence.
With an electric mixer, beat at medium speed for 2-3 minutes. (At first, I did not use the hand mixer to combine the batter because I remembered reading somewhere that while using egg substitutes, in this case, tofu, beating the batter is not recommended, and I was so worried to see such a diluted batter and it was also having a lot of small lumps.  So anyhow, I decided to use my hand mixer to get rid of the lumps, but still, the batter was considerably thin).
Pour the batter evenly into both 9-inch cake pans.  (or fill the 6 muffin cups halfway with batter and divide the remaining batter between both 8-inch pans).
Bake this cake for 25 to 30 minutes until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. (Check the cupcakes after 15 minutes).  I  placed 1 pan on the middle shelf and then another on the bottom shelf set the timer for 25 minutes, and switched the pans around 12 minutes.  Switching the pan means moving the pan from the middle shelf to the bottom and the bottom shelf pan to the top.  This is done to ensure the even baking of both cakes.  One of my make was done exactly at 25 minutes, and the other one took 30 minutes.
Let the cakes cool completely before removing them from the pans.  The time mentioned in the original recipe was 15 minutes, so I tried to transfer the cake to a wire rack after 20 minutes, which was a little messy.  So I left the other cake in the pan for quite some time.  Maybe after an hour, I touched the bottom of that pan and found that it had cooled completely, so I transferred it to the wire rack.
The cake should cool completely on the wire rack before frosting.  I baked the cakes on Saturday and frosted them on Sunday.  I left it on the kitchen counter and covered it with a bamboo basket.  You could also refrigerate the cake to cool it off.
Sift the mix.
Add the melted butter, hot milk, vanilla, and baking soda.  (I read in the same book that adding a pinch of baking soda to icings prevents hardening and cracking, so icing stays moist)
Beat the mix using a hand mixer at medium-high speed.  Add a few drops of water/milk if required.
This was my first experience frosting an eggless chocolate cake, so I followed the steps in the book.
First, I placed the bottom layer upside down so the rounded side (top of the cake would be on the serving plate).  If you have a dome top on the cake, even it out by slicing it with a serrated knife and then place it upside-down.
Spread about ½ cup to ¾ cup of frosting on top of the bottom layer.  Don't use hard strokes; spread it gently using an offset metal spatula or plastic spatula.
Place the second layer on the first, cut, or domed side up.
Frost the sides of the cake first with another ½ cup of frosting.
Finally, frost the top of the second layer.
As you all know, the options are endless.  Being the rookie I am, and because my son loves M&M's, I used them to line the cake.

Let's prepare the cake batter for the first layer. To the first bowl of cake mix add, ¼ cup of pureed silken tofu, ¼ cup of yogurt, ⅓rd of a cup of oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 and ¼ of milk. Beat well with electric hand held beater. The batter should be smooth. Now we have the cake batter ready for one layer of cake.
Repeat the above for the remaining 2 packets of cake mix too.
To the first bowl of cake batter add few drops of pink color and beat well.  Add more food color if needed.  Wash the beaters and then repeat the same for the 2nd color. 
To the second bowl of cake batter add few drops of red color and beat well with clean beaters so that the pink color from the first bowl doesn't mix with this red color. Use red gel paste if you want to get nice red color batter. 
The third bowl of cake batter will be left white. 
Now follow the instructions given with the checkerboard pan set to fill the batter.  As always line the pans with parchment paper and fill it ⅔rds full of batter.  Use a ladle/spoon to fill in the batter because the dividers that come with the pan are tricky to be filled with the batter.
The remaining batter was enough to make 24 mini cupcakes.
Preheat the oven at 350F/180C.
I placed 2 pans on the top rack and the 3rd on the middle rack.  Halfway through the baking brought the top shelf ones to the middle and the middle one to the top, so that the cakes would bake evenly.  It was quite tricky to move it.  Use a good oven mitt in both hands and be careful.
Bake it for about 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the pan comes out clean and also watch out for the cake pulling off from the sides of the pan.  Mine was ready in about 32 minutes.
Baking time for the cupcakes would be around 12 minutes.
Remove the pans from the oven and place it on wire racks to cool completely.
After about 10-15 minutes remove the cake out of the pan and let it cool completely before you can frost.
In a large bowl beat together the butter, icing sugar, vanilla extract and few drops of pink food color and a teaspoon or more milk if needed, to get a spreadable consistency. Start with 4 cups of sugar and gradually increase it if needed.
Level the cakes to cut off the dome.  Then proceed to frost each layer as usual and cover it up with the frosting.

Add the butter to the flour mix and cut it into pieces with a fork or pastry blender.
Do not try to make it smooth but work towards making it a coarse and crumbly mixture that looks like bread crumbs. It is not necessary that all the butter should be mashed.  You can leave some big pieces as large as peas to yield flaky scones.
Stir in the chocolate chips or other optional add ons like dried cranberries, raisins etc.
Now add the milk and egg replacer mixture and keep mixing but do not over mix which will develop gluten in the flour and will produce tough scones.  Mix with a wooden spoon or just your fingers until the wet and dry ingredients are moistened. The dough will not be smooth and it's ok.
Make the dough into a ball.  For this you may need to add just a few drops of milk or water.
Lightly flour a large cutting board or a clean kitchen counter and place the dough on that.  Pat the dough to a ½ inch thick circle and cut into 8-10 pieces or use a heart shape cookie cutter to cut out heart shaped scones.  Re-roll the dough to cut as many hearts as possible.
