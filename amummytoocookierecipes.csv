Chocolate Pistachio Cookies,Emily Leary,NA,NA,Cookies,American,Prep Time20 minutes mins,Cook Time12 minutes mins,NA,Total Time32 minutes mins,20 cookies,12,"Preheat the oven to 150C / 300F (130C fan-assisted).
Spread the pistachios on a tray and toast for 10 minutes. You can skip this step if you like, but it helps bring out the pistachio flavour and give them a bit of extra crunch. Tip onto a plate and set aside to cool.
Turn the oven up to 180C / 350F (160C fan-assisted).
In a large bowl, beat together the butter, golden syrup and sugar until fluffy.
Beat in the egg and the vanilla until well combined.
Add the flour and the baking powder and mix well – you should now have a sticky, light dough.
Fold in the milk chocolate chips and pistachios.
Use a large ice cream scoop the dough, flattening off against the side of the bowl, then roll the dough into a ball with your hands. It’s an easy way to get 20 equally sized cookies. Alternatively, you can weigh the dough - each ball will weigh about 55g each.
Place the balls of dough on baking sheets lined with greaseproof paper, being sure to place each cookie at least an inch apart so that they don’t stick together when they spread. Squash each of them a little with the flat of your hand.
Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden at the edges. Get them out of the oven before they’re fully browned so that they stay chewy when cool.
While still hot, place a tumbler over a cookie and gently move it in small circles to bring the cookie into a neat circle. Repeat with all of the cookies - this only works when they are fresh from the oven and soft.

Add the water and melted butter. Stir to a raggedy dough.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a clean, lightly oiled bowl.
Cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 1 hour until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 200C/390F (180C/350F fan). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Turn the dough out onto a clean surface, knead briefly to knock out any large air bubbles, then divide into four pieces. Work one piece at a time, covering the other pieces with a tea towel or cling film (saran wrap) so that they don't dry out.
Roll the dough out a little more to give a long thin rope of dough about 30cm (12 inches) long. The dough will be elastic because of the developed gluten, so you may have to cover, rest and then continue rolling if you find it is retracting.
Cut the rope of dough into 6. Roll them again so that they're each about 7.5cm (3 inches) long.
Put the demerara sugar on a plate and place the lengths of dough on the plate, one after the other, gently rolling to lightly coat in sugar. The dough should be naturally tacky enough to pick up the sugar, but if think the lengths have dried out, you can brush them very sparingly with water before rolling in the sugar.
Loop each length of dough to give a teardrop shape with a little cross-over at the point. Place each cookie on a baking sheet lined with baking paper as you work.

Add the egg and vanilla. Whisk together.
Add the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt (if using). Mix until evenly combined and starting to clump.
Turn out onto an un-floured board and knead only as much as it takes to get a smooth ball of dough.
Divide the dough into four and roll each into flattened discs.
Add food colouring to each to give different shades I used the following for each ball of dough: 1) yellow 2) green 3) green and blue 4) green and red.
Knead each ball, folding until the colour is distributed - it's fine if it's a little streaky as this will add to the effect.
If the dough balls feels too soft (this can happen if your kitchen is warm) then wrap and pop them the fridge to rest and cool for 15 minutes.
Flour your surface lightly, then start to tear small pieces of dough off each colour and dot them around to create a sort of camouflage pattern. Gather the dough together into a slab.
Roll out to approximately 7-8mm thick (approx 1/3 inch).
Cut out the dinosaur shapes. Aim to cut them close together to reduce the need to reroll too many times.
Gather the offcuts and, just as you did before, gather into a slab, which you can then re-roll to cut further dinosaur shapes.
Place the cookies on baking sheets lined with greaseproof paper. They don't spread much at all, so can be place quite close together.

Rub the mix through until you get an even crumb.
Add the vanilla extract and a tbsp of cold water, then cut it through the mix with a round knife.
Eventually, you should be able to work the mix into a soft dough. You can add a drop more water if necessary.
Turn the dough out on to a floured surface – it’s a bit too squidgy, wrap and chill it for 10 minutes
Roll the dough to 1cm thick – I like to do this between two sheets of baking paper as it avoids sticking. Alternatively, you could lightly flour your work surface.
Cut out your biscuits using a round 7cm cutter. Gather up the offcuts and keep cutting until you have around 15 rounds.
Place the rounds on baking tray lined with baking paper and press a few chocolate drops into each one.

Gluten-free ice cream sandwich recipe,Emily Leary,5, 1 ,"Cookies, Desserts and sweet treats",American,Prep Time20 minutes mins,Cook Time20 minutes mins,NA,Total Time40 minutes mins,NA,15,"Take a large roasting tray and spoon the ice cream into the centre.
Spread the ice cream out evenly across the pan. Mine ended up being about 2cm deep, and return it to the freezer for 10 minutes to firm back up.
Using an 8cm diameter cookie cutter cut out 12 ice cream pucks for the filling.
Separate the filling from the rest of the ice cream (you can return this to the tub) and return the tray to the freezer until ready to use.
While the discs are chilling, tip the Betty Crocker Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix into a bowl.
Add the egg and oil as directed on the packet.
Mix it up.
Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. The following technique will help you get identically sized, perfectly round cookies that are just the right thickness to make ice cream sandwiches with.
Take a tablespoon of cookie mix, level it off and place it flat side down on a greaseproof lined baking tray. Repeat, making sure not to space them too closely together on the tray.
Press each ball down with the flat of your hand, aiming to apply even pressure so that the resulting discs are nice and round.
Bake at 180C/355F (160C/320F) for 6 minute and 30 seconds or until just becoming golden brown around the edges - depending on your oven capacity, you may need to bake in batches.
Cool completely on a rack. All in all, you should get 25 cookies, but you'll only need 24 for the ice cream sandwiches, so you can eat the extra one straight away. Yay!
Once the cookies are cooled to room temperature, turn one upside down, then take a disc of ice cream filling out of the freezer and place on top.
Next, push one or two of your favourite sweets into the centre - here I used jelly babies.
Finally, place another cookie on top to create your chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and eat immediately! NOTE: you can wrap the cookie sandwiches in freezer paper and refreeze, if you wish, but if you intend to do so, do not place jelly sweets in the centre as they will become too hard after freezing!",8,1.8 l (3.8 pint) gluten-free vanilla ice cream,Betty Crocker Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix,1 medium free range eggs,90 ml (3.04 floz) vegetable oil (canola oil),1.8 l (3.8 pint) gluten-free vanilla ice cream,Betty Crocker Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix,1 medium free range eggs,90 ml (3.04 floz) vegetable oil (canola oil),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,A Mummy Too,https://www.amummytoo.co.uk/gluten-free-ice-cream-sandwich-recipe/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Work with half the dough at a time, keeping the other half wrapped in the fridge until you're ready for it. This helps to keep it cold, which makes it easier to work with.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, roll out to about 50-70mm (1/4 inches) thick.
Press the cookie cutter into the dough to cut out the cookie shape. I find it helps to dip the cutter in a little flour to prevent it sticking.

Add the flour and the baking powder. Mix well.
Stir in half (100g / 3.5oz) the dark chocolate chips.  You should now have a sticky, light dough .
Take 1 tbsp scoops and place, well spaced, on a baking sheet lined with baking paper.
Top with 3 or 4 more of the chocolate chips per cookies.
Bake for 8-10 minutes until they just start to go golden at the edges. Aim to get them out before they’re too browned so that they stay chewy when cool.
While still hot on the tray, top the cookies with more chocolate chips and sprinkle with a little salt.

Put the flour, sugar and mixed spice in a large bowl. Mix well.
Add the butter to the bowl. Rub the mix through until you get an even crumb. 
Add in the lemon extract and milk. Mix with a round knife until the dough starts to clump.
Use your hands to gather the dough into a ball. If it's unmanageably soft, wrap and pop in the fridge for 15 mins to chill and firm.
Turn the dough out on to a floured surface. For space, I find it easiest to work with half the dough at a time.
Roll the dough out very thinly - just 2-3mm (1/8 of an inch).
Cut as many men out as you can. Gather up any offcuts, rolling and cutting until all the dough is used up.
Place the cookies on lined trays. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 8 mins until just colouring at the edges.
Allow the cookies to cool enough to firm up, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Lightly dust your surface with cornflour. Roll your red sugar paste out very thinly.
Use your gingerbread man cutter to cut out as many shapes as you can.
Trim away the off the head and ends of the arms and legs to create little Santa suits. I used the head part of my gingerbread man cutter to do this, creating a shape almost like a romper suit.
Dab a very sparing touch of water onto the surface of a cookie.
Apply a Santa suit, smoothing gently with your fingers to work into shape as needed. You can use offcuts to shape a little hat for your Santas too.
Note: it's best to apply all of your suits before moving on as otherwise the sugar paste dry out and become harder to work with.
Start with the white icing pen. Drawing in tiny circles, you'll need to draw: trim along the wrists and ankles of the suit; trim and a bobble on the hat; Father Christmas's beard; trim running down the centre of his suit to his waist.
Now use a black icing pen to give Father Christmas a friendly smile. You can also draw a belt along his middle.
Finally, use your yellow pen to add a little belt buckle.
Form two small balls of sugar paste and apply to the moistened cookie surface (see pics).
As before, apply a suit (or dress), smoothing gently with your fingers to work into shape as needed.
Add all the same details as you gave Father Christmas, plus any extra flourishes you fancy.
Repeat until all of your cookies are decorated.

Add the flour and the baking powder and mix well – you should now have a sticky, light dough.
Fold in the white chocolate chips.
Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough, flattening off against the side of the bowl, then roll the dough into a ball with your hands. This is the best way to get 30 equally sized cookies.
Place the balls of dough on baking sheets lined with greaseproof paper, being sure to place each cookie at least an inch apart so that they don’t stick together when they spread.

Put the sugar, flour and semolina in a large bowl.
Add the cold, cubed butter and rub in until a crumb is achieved. It's normal for it to go clumpy, as long are there are no lumps of butter.
Tip the dough out into a well-greased, non-stick, medium roasting tin. Spread evenly and press down firmly with the flat of your hand.
Prick the dough all over with a fork - this helps to stop the biscuit puffing up during baking.
Bake for 25-30 mins or until firm and pale golden.
Allow to cool until firm. You can then either leave in the tin to cool completely or, if you want to speed the process up a bit, you can carefully tip the biscuit onto a cooling rack, then return it to the tin once cool.
While the biscuit is cooling, put the honeycomb pieces into a small bowl.
Position your edible gold spray about 5-7.5cm (2-3 inches) and spray while gently shaking the bowl until the honeycomb is evenly coated. Set aside to dry.
With the cold biscuit layer in the tin, pour the caramel on top and spread gently to the edges.
Melt the white chocolate, allow to cool then pour over the caramel, distributing evenly, then level off.
Melt the milk chocolate and drizzle very thinly all over the white chocolate in swirls.
Scatter the honeycomb on top.
Cover and place in the fridge to set for 30 minutes or until the white chocolate is set all the way to the centre. .
