Scoop 6 even portions of cookie dough onto two separate baking sheets (for a total of 12 cookies), leaving at least 2 inches of space between cookies as they will spread.

Grease an 8×8 baking pan with cooking spray. Then line with parchment paper, making sure the parchment paper goes up the sides of the pan so you can easily remove the bars. Spray the parchment paper again lightly.
Cream together the butter, vanilla and sugar, for about 3 minutes, until ultra light and fluffy then slowly mix in the flour until combined. It will be a little crumbly, but that's ok.
Press the dough into your parchment paper lined baking dish.
Use a fork to poke holes all over the surface of the dough. This will prevent the dough from doming while it bakes, helping to make sure you have one flat and even layer for the base.
Bake for about 25 minutes or just until it starts to show a hint of being golden brown.
When done, lift the parchment paper & cookie layer out of the baking dish and let everything cool on wire racks while you make the caramel layer.
Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat and start whisking everything but the vanilla extract together.
Keep whisking and be patient while the caramel mixture starts to come to a slow boil.
Turn down the heat to a simmer and continue to cook, whisking the entire time. I stirred this for about 20 minutes until it was visibly thickened and had darkened to a perfect caramel color. The temperature should be between 220-225 degrees Fahrenheit.
Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the vanilla extract.
Place the shortbread back into the baking dish, making sure the parchment paper is positioned correctly.
Carefully pour the hot caramel over the cookie layer in one smooth motion.
Allow this to cool on on the counter for about 10 minutes, then place in the fridge to cool for about an hour.
Place the chocolate chips in a medium size microwave-safe bowl.
Heat the heavy cream in the microwave until it is very hot, but not necessarily boiling.
Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips, then cover the bowl with a plate. Allow this to sit for 5 minutes so that the chocolate can melt.
Then whisk until the chocolate is completely smooth. If it isn't 100% smooth, microwave in 15 second intervals until it is smooth. Then stir in the vanilla extract.
Allow the chocolate to cool for a few minutes before pouring over the caramel layer.
Smooth out with an offset spatula if needed.
Allow the chocolate layer to cool on the counter for 5 to 10 minutes before sprinkling with the finishing salt. If you put the salt on too soon, the salt will dissolve.
Let everything cool on the counter for about 1 hour and then cover tightly and refrigerate, ideally for a minimum of 5 hours but for best results overnight.

Remove the dough and separate it into three equal pieces.
Shape one piece of the dough into a 4x2 rectangle (approximate, just use eyes to guess close), wrap it securely in wax paper and place it in the fridge. (This will be the white portion of the cookies.)
Add other two portions of dough to two separate bowls. Color one dough portion red and mix until it's incorporated. Color the other dough portion blue, mixing again until it's incorporated. Add enough dye to get the colors that you want. Remember that dye will deepen slightly as it sits.
Form both red and blue dough into separate rectangles between wax paper as in step 6. Refrigerate all dough for 30 minutes.
Place the red dough in between two pieces of wax paper and roll it into a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Repeat separately for white and blue dough.
Peel the top layer of wax paper off of the red dough and then peel the wax paper off one side of the white dough and use the other side to transfer the white dough on top of the red dough. Peel off the wax paper from one side of the blue dough and use the other side to transfer it atop the white dough. Very lightly roll the three layers together using a rolling pin.
To get a perfect rectangle, take a sharp knife and cut off any edges that stick over a rectangle.
Starting at the shorter end of the rectangle, roll the dough as tightly as possible into a log. Wrap the log in wax paper. Stand the roll up in a glass in the fridge for 4 hours or freezer for 30 minutes. (I've included a picture of this. Standing them up prevents them from getting a flat side.)
