Cheesecake Stuffed Gingerbread Cookies,Alyssa Rivers,12/15/23,5,1,Holiday,45 minutes,10 minutes,NA,55 minutes,18 cookies,12,"Add 8 ounces cream cheese, ¼ cup granulated sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract to a medium-sized bowl and beat with a hand mixer until smooth.
Place parchment or wax paper on a large plate or baking sheet and use a small cookie scoop to scoop 1 ½ teaspoon portions of the cream cheese mixture onto the paper. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
While the cheesecake filling chills, prepare the cookie dough by sifting 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, ¼ teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, and ¼ teaspoon ground cloves together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat ½ cup unsalted butter, ¼ cup granulated sugar, ¾ cup dark brown sugar, and ¼ cup molasses together. Add 1 large egg and 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla and beat until combined.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet and beat until just combined. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes.
Make the spiced sugar coating by whisking together ½ cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon ground ginger, ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg, and ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves in a small bowl. Set aside until needed.
When the dough and cheesecake filling is nearly done chilling, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Remove the dough from the fridge, and for each cookie, use a medium cooking scoop to scoop two 1 ½ tablespoon portions of dough. Gently press them each out into discs that are about 1 ½ inches wide. Keep the center thicker and the edges a bit thinner. If the dough rips or tears, use your fingers to pinch it back together. Use your thumb to make the disc slightly bowl-shaped.
Place one of the chilled cheesecake filling scoops into the center of one of the discs and top with a second one. Very carefully but firmly pinch just the very edges of the two discs together to create a seal around the filling. Be careful not to pinch too much of the dough, otherwise the filling will squeeze out the other side. If the dough cracks on the edges or on the tops, use your fingers to smooth it out. This dough is very pliable, and it’s alright to warm it up a bit with your fingers to make it smoother.
Once the two discs are sealed together, gently round out the pinched edge with your fingers and give a light roll of the dough to form a uniform and smooth circle where it was sealed.
Roll the dough in the spiced sugar and place on the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 ½-3 inches between cookies. Bake for 10 minutes.

Once the cookies are completely cooled, make the glaze by whisking 2-3 tablespoons milk into 2 cups powdered sugar.

To brown the butter, heat a medium saucepan to medium high heat. Add the sliced butter, whisking frequently. You will notice the butter starting to become frothy on the top and brown specks will start to form along the bottom. You have to watch it closely because the turn happens quickly and you don’t want it to burn.

If you don’t have the template mats, use the provided template placed under the silicone mats.
Bring one inch of water to a simmer in a small pot.
Wipe the bowl of a stand mixer clean with white vinegar and add the egg whites and granulated sugar. Whisk to combine. Place the bowl over the simmering water being sure the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is frothy, about 2-3 minutes.
Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until glossy, stiff peaks form and the bowl is cooled to room temperature.
While the egg whites whip, sift the almond flour and powdered sugar twice through a fine mesh sieve.
Add the almond flour mixture to the whipped egg whites and fold, pressing against the side of the bowl as you go. The batter should flow like lava off the spatula in a steady line without breaks and should be able to make a figure 8 without any breaks. The batter should melt back into itself after 10-15 seconds. If it does not and instead just sits on top of the batter beneath it, fold a few more times and try the figure 8 again.
Add the batter to a piping bag, taking care to not overfill the bag. Half to two-thirds full is plenty. Snip off the end of the bag, leaving about a quarter inch hole. Pipe the macarons at a 90 degree angle, making a slight swirl motion after you stop piping to prevent dimples.
Tap the pan firmly on the counter 3-4 times to help remove any air bubbles. You can use a toothpick to pop bubbles that come to the surface but do not pop on their own.
Let the macarons rest for 30-60 minutes, until a skin forms on the outside and they do not stick when you lightly touch them.
While the macarons rest, preheat the oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit. When the macarons are ready, bake for 15-18 minutes.
To test if the macarons are ready, touch the top of one. It should not jiggle or move around at all, and the top should feel firm. You can gently peel it off the parchment or silicone mat. A macaron that is done will peel off with an in-tact bottom whereas a macaron that needs more time will stick and leave the bottom behind.
Once done baking, remove the macarons from the oven and let them cool on the tray. Once cooled, pipe your chosen filling in the center of one shell and gently top with a second shell.
If you would like the macarons to develop deeper flavor, fill them and store them in an airtight container in the fridge overnight. This process is called maturing and will allow the shells to absorb the flavor of the filling and the shells to soften slightly.",6,▢ 150 grams granulated sugar,▢ 150 grams egg whites,▢ 150 grams almond flour,▢ 150 grams powdered sugar,▢ Filling of choice see tips for suggestions,"▢ Gel food coloring, optional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Recipe Critic,https://therecipecritic.com/macarons/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This recipe does not require any chilling time, so you’re ready to roll out your cookies! Split the dough into 2-3 pieces and roll them one at a time on a lightly floured surface until they are ¼ inch thick. Use a heart cookie cutter to cut out your cookies. Press the scraps together and set aside to rest for about 5 minutes. Reroll the scraps and cut more cookies until all the dough has been used. I used a 3-inch heart and was able to get 18 cookies.
Place the cookies on the parchment lined cookie sheets leaving 1 ½ inches between them. Bake for 6-8 minutes, rotating the pan at the 4 minute mark. I find this gives the cookies an even bake. The edges will be just set and the cookies will be very light in color and should have very minimal coloring underneath them.
Let the cookies cool on the pan for 2 minutes for the shape to set before transferring to a cooling rack. Frost once they are cooled or store in an airtight container until you are ready to frost them.
Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, mix the powdered sugar and meringue powder together on low.
Add 4-5 tablespoons of water and mix together on high speed for about 1 minute. The icing should be pretty stiff. Add additional water 1 tablespoon at a time until the icing is about the consistency of soft serve ice cream and forms soft peaks. Reserve ⅓ cup, roughly, of icing and cover tightly with plastic wrap. This will be for the lettering on the cookies.
With the remaining icing, add additional water 1-2 teaspoons at a time until when the whisk is raised the icing drips back into the bowl and the lines of icing take about 10 seconds to melt back into the icing. This is the thin icing that will be used to fill, or flood, your cookies. Separate into small bowls and tint the icing your chosen colors, I chose to use a pastel color pallet. Color the reserved stiff frosting red or black for lettering.
When ready to ice, fill your piping bags with the icing colors and tie off the ends to prevent the icing from overflowing out the top of the bags. Avoid filing them more than ½-⅔ full. Snip the end of the bag just barely, leaving a very small hole to pipe from.
Use light pressure to trace the outside of the heart, not letting the tip of the bag touch the cookie unless it’s to start or stop piping. Once the outline has been piped, use stronger pressure to fill the center of the cookie. It doesn’t have to be perfect, use a toothpick or a scribe tool to swirl the icing around until all the holes are filled. Let it set and the icing will melt into itself and smooth out. Set aside and let it crust over, at least an hour.
Snip the very end of the bag of the stiffer frosting for the lettering. Once the base icing has formed a crust, pipe your chosen words onto the cookies. Let the cookies sit overnight or 24 hours to fully dry. They should be uncovered at room temperature. Once the icing is completely dry the cookies can be stacked and stored in an airtight container for up to 7 days.",13,▢ 2 cups all purpose flour,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ ½ teaspoon baking powder,▢ ½ cup unsalted butter softened,▢ 2/3 cup granulated sugar,▢ 2 egg yolks,▢ 2 tablespoons sour cream,▢ 1 ½ tablespoon vanilla extract,▢ 1 teaspoon lemon extract optional,▢ 4 cups powdered sugar sifted,▢ 3 tablespoons meringue powder,▢ 9-12 tablespoons water room temperature,▢ gel food coloring,The Recipe Critic,https://therecipecritic.com/valentines-day-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the bowl of a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to beat together the butter, both sugars and vanilla until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and add the molasses and egg. Beat again for 1-2 minutes, until incorporated.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix on low until a dough begins to form. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl again before mixing on medium speed. Add the milk to help the dough not be too crumbly.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out to ¼ inch thick. Using the already printed and cut out template for the house pieces, use a sharp paring knife to cut out the pieces of the house.
Carefully transfer the cut-out pieces to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between them. Bake for 11-14 minutes, until the edges and centers are set. Let cool completely on the baking sheets.
Once completely cooled, prepare the royal icing to use as glue for construction.
In the bowl of a mixer, add the powdered sugar and meringue powder. Whisk together. Add 4 tablespoons of water and use the paddle attachment to mix on low speed. As the powdered sugar becomes more moistened as it mixes, increase the speed and beat until a very thick, smooth icing is made. If it is not moist enough to incorporate all the dry ingredients, add the 5th tablespoon of water. This icing should be very, very thick in order to hold together the heavy gingerbread.
Transfer the royal icing to a piping bag or a large ziplock bag. It will dry quickly if left exposed, so be sure to cover any extra icing tightly with plastic wrap.
Assemble the houses by using the royal icing as glue. Be generous and work quickly, as the royal icing will begin to crust over quite quickly. Pipe icing along the side of the front of the house then press the side piece to it to form the first corner. Repeat with the second side.
Pipe icing along the two sides of the back piece and press firmly against the two standing sides to form the third and fourth corners. Add more icing the inside of the corners as needed to reinforce their stability.
Pipe icing along the roofline and top of the side on one side of the house. Press the first roof piece in place. Outline the remaining opening with icing and carefully press the last roof piece on.

This is the thin icing that will be used to fill, or flood, the cookies. Separate into small bowls and tint the icing with your chosen colors. Cover each bowl tightly with plastic wrap when not being used. This icing will dry and crust over very quickly, so keeping it covered is important.
Separate the reserved thicker icing into bowls and tint the bowls the colors you want to make your eggs.

While the dough is chilling prepare the poppy seed filling.
Once the dough is chilled, preheat the oven to 350°. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thick.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the 2 cups all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon baking powder. Set aside.
In another medium bowl, whisk together the ½ cup softened unsalted butter and ⅔ cup granulated sugar for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the 2 egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sour cream, 1 ½ tablespoons vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon lemon extract and mix until just combined.
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until just barely combined.
Split the dough into 2-3 pieces and roll them one at a time on a lightly floured surface until they are ¼ inch thick. Use a Christmas tree cookie cutter (or alternative shapes!) to cut out the cookies.
Press the scraps together and set them aside to rest for about 5 minutes. Then re-roll the scraps and cut more cookies until all the dough has been used.
Place the cookies on the parchment-lined cookie sheets, leaving 1 ½ inches between them.
Bake the cookies for 7-8 minutes, rotating the pan in the oven after 4 minutes to ensure they bake evenly. The edges will be just set and the cookies will be very light in color and should have very minimal coloring underneath them.
Let the cookies cool on the pan for 2 minutes for the shape to set before transferring to a cooling rack. Let the cookies cool completely before frosting.
Whisk 4 cups sifted powdered sugar with 3 tablespoons meringue powder in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer before adding 1 tablespoon light corn syrup, ½ teaspoon clear vanilla extract if desired, and about 6 or 7 tablespoons of the 8-12 tablespoons water. Slowly mix with the paddle attachment or a hand mixer until the sugar is moistened, then beat on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes. It should be quite thick at this stage.
If you would like to use some of the icing to pipe more defined details that will hold their shape, reserve some of the icing in a separate bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
For smooth designs, add additional water to the icing 1 or 2 teaspoons at a time until the icing drips back into the bowl and the lines of icing take about 10 seconds to melt back into the rest when the whisk is lifted out of the bowl. If it melts back in too quickly, add a tablespoon or two of powdered sugar to thicken it up again.
Color the different bowls of frosting using your choice of gel food coloring. Use piping bags or dip the completely cooled cookies as desired, keeping the icing covered tightly between using colors, as it will dry and crust over quickly.
