Divide the dough in half and shape into disks. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for about 4 hours or overnight. (This step is important because the dough gets soft quickly and is very sticky when soft, so it really needs to be thoroughly chilled.)

Once all of the sugar is added, scrape down the sides of the bowl and increase the speed to medium-high.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula or bowl scraper and knead with your hands to create a ball of dough.

Meringue Cookies,John Kanell,4.94,400,"American, english, French",20 minutes,NA,NA,20 minutes,48 meringues,6," Set oven to 200F. Separate the egg whites one at a time into a small bowl then transfer each white to the bowl of your stand mixer. You really don’t want to get any broken yolks in your bowl so separating them individually contains the damage if anything happens.
Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl then begin mixing on low and gradually increase the speed to high.
Once the egg whites have frothed up you can begin SLOWLY sprinkling in the sugar. This step makes a big difference in your final meringues so remember to take your time and add the sugar in gradually. You can do is a teaspoon at a time or just sprinkle it in slow as slow can be. After the sugar has been added it’s time to beat in some vanilla.
 Your meringue is done once it has a Thick marshmallowy texture and can hold a nice peak. I would caution agains letting it sit for too long as it will pose consistency and not pipe as nicely if left to it’s own devices for too long. If you are coloring the meringue I suggest you add a SMALL, tiny amount of coloring in with a toothpick or skewer then beat in with the the whisk attachment to distribute the color. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with the tip snipped off.
Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet and press the parchment paper down. The meringue acts like glue and gives you a nice stable base to pipe on. Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each for airflow. Squeeze the piping bag while it’s about 1/2 an inch from the paper, lift as you squeeze then stop squeezing but continue to lift the finish the meringue.
Place on the center rack to bake at 200 for about an hour then turn the oven off and keep closed for an additional 1-2 hours. The meringue cookies are done when they're are dried throughout.

Place it on a sheet of parchment paper or plastic, wrap it tightly and twist the ends to seal. Chill it in the refrigerator for at least an hour or up to 72 hours. (I've found the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to pop it into an empty cardboard paper towel roll.)
Once the dough is chilled, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Sprinkle sanding sugar on a clean surface or a rimming baking sheet. Unwrap the dough and roll the dough in the sugar until it is well coated. (Roll while pressing the dough down so the sugar sticks to the surface.)
