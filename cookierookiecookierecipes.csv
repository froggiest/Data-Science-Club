Scrape around the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure all of the flour has been incorporated.
Divide the dough in half and place one half on a large piece of parchment paper. Roll out the dough to be ¼-inch thick, and transfer the dough with the parchment paper to a large sheet pan.
Roll out the other half of the dough and place the rolled dough (with the parchment paper) on top of the first half of rolled dough on the sheet pan.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (To freeze the cookie dough at this point, cover the rolled dough on the baking sheet with plastic wrap and foil. Freeze until ready to bake).

4 cups powdered sugar, ¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Mix in enough of the white food coloring to make white icing. Pour the white icing about an inch deep into a dish slightly larger than the size of a cookie.
Food coloring
Test the icing consistency by turning a cookie upside down and dipping it halfway top-down and flat into the icing. Let the icing drip off the top of the cookie, then quickly flip the cookie over and place on a wire rack. The icing should be thin enough for dipping but thick enough not to drip off the cookies. (If too thin, add a little more sugar; if too thick, add a little corn syrup/water mixture.)
Frost all the cookies with white icing and let them dry several hours or overnight.
Use a different food-safe paintbrush for each color.
When the cookies are completely dry, add several drops of one color of gel food coloring to a very small bowl. Add a tiny bit of water or vodka and mix well.
Extra water or vodka
Before splattering the cookies, test the food color consistency over a piece of paper or paper towel – it should splatter easily – not too watery or thick.
Splatter the ‘paint’ by dipping the paintbrush in the food coloring, hold it (brush side down) over what is being splattered, and use your other hand to tap your wrist. Alternately, this is very messy but works a little better, hold the brush (brush side down) over the cookie and flick the food coloring off of the brush and onto the cookie with the tip of a finger on the opposite hand.
Use a different paintbrush for each color and splatter one color until done with that color, then repeat with other colors until all cookies are decorated.

1 cup unsalted butter, ⅔ cup granulated sugar
Beat in the egg, vanilla, almond, and lemon/orange zest (if using) until well blended.
1 large egg, 1 teaspoon lemon or orange zest, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, ¼ teaspoon almond extract
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
2¼ cups all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon kosher salt
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture all at once and mix on low speed until just incorporated.
Lay out a baking sheet with parchment paper (waxed paper) and sprinkle a little flour on top.
Divide the dough equally into 2 portions (more if you have doubled the recipe). Using lightly floured hands, hold 1 portion of dough and gently shape it into a disc.
Place the disc on the floured paper, roll gently into a ¼-inch high oval or rectangle. Cut the cookie dough into shapes, and place cookies on parchment lined cookie sheets.
Repeat the process until all the dough is used.
Tightly cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight).
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F.
Space out the cut-out dough on parchment-lined cookie sheets and bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn.
Take out of the oven, remove from the baking pan and cool on a cooling rack. Once completely cooled, the decorating can begin.
Place the powdered sugar in a large mixing bowl and turn the hand mixer to the lowest speed.
4 cups powdered sugar
In a large measuring cup, stir together the corn syrup, water, and almond extract.
½ cup water, 6 tablespoons white corn syrup, ¾ teaspoon almond extract
With the mixer running, slowly drizzle ½ cup of the corn syrup mixture over the powdered sugar and mix until incorporated. Scrape down the sides as needed. The glaze’s consistency should be similar to sweetened condensed milk.
(Set the reserved corn syrup mixture aside to use only if needed.)
Turn the mixer to medium-low and mix until the glaze is smooth and creamy. If the glaze is too thick, stir in reserved corn syrup mixture, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it is the correct consistency. If the glaze is too thin, add more powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time.
Pour half of the glaze into a small shallow bowl – be sure the diameter of the bowl is larger than the largest cookie. Cover the remaining half with plastic wrap to avoid a hard shell forming on top.
Air bubbles will form in the glaze, but just take a small spoon and stir it slowly through the glaze to get rid of them.
Get a drop of food coloring on a toothpick and swirl it through the glaze. Begin with a tiny amount (gel food coloring is potent) and be sure not to mix the glaze too much or the glaze could turn into a solid color.

To glaze a cookie, have a second bowl sitting next to the bowl with the glaze.
Hold onto the cookie by the edges and turn it upside down. Dip the top of the cookie into the glaze being sure the glaze covers the entire surface of the cookie.
Lift the cookie straight up out of the glaze and hold it above the second bowl. Allow the excess glaze to drip off (about 5-10 seconds). Once the glaze stops dripping, flip the cookie over and place it on a cooling rack.
Allow the glaze to dry completely before storing the cookies in an airtight container.

Set speed to low, add the flour mixture all-at-once, and stir just until no flour is visible.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator until firm, for about 1 hour.
Note: Chilling the cookie dough before baking is essential. It helps the cookies hold their shape and prevents excessive spreading.
While the cookie dough rests, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, set oven rack to middle position, and preheat oven to 350°F.
When the dough is ready, form it into ¾-inch balls.
Firmly roll each ball in the finely chopped Crème de Menthe chips, and place the balls, 2-inches apart, on the parchment-lined baking sheets.

Note: Be careful the chocolate doesn’t get too hot – white chocolate is sensitive and can seize up if it gets overheated.
Add the hot mixture to the cooler mixture and stir until smooth.
Add the Crème de Menthe or flavoring and mix until smooth.

Once creamed, mix in the eggs, vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, sour cream, and salt. Add the flour one cup at a time, mixing as you go.
2 cups granulated sugar, 1 cup unsalted butter, 3 large eggs, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 cup sour cream, 6 cups all-purpose flour, ½ tsp kosher salt
Form the dough into a large disc and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Towards the end of chilling, preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
Once chilled, cut the dough into two sections. (If you'd like the cookies to be smaller, you can cut the dough into 4 pieces) Work with one section at a time. On a well-floured (important) surface, roll out each section until about ¼-½"" thick. Spoon 2 tbsp of jam onto each rolled section and smooth out evenly. Roll each section lengthwise, making 2 logs. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into about 10-12 1-inch cookies. I used a bread knife. If you're making smaller cookies, you can make them thinner as well.
¼ cup strawberry jam
Place cookies on the prepared sheet, making sure they're about 1½ inches apart.
Bake for 10-14 minutes for the bigger cookies and 8-10 minutes for the smaller cookies. Watch closely because ovens vary. Cookies are done when the edges begin to brown and the middles are totally set.
Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to cooling rack.
While the cookies cool, microwave the white chocolate and olive oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring between sessions. When fully melted, use a spoon to put the white chocolate ""icing"" on each cookie.
1 cup white chocolate chips, 1 tbsp olive oil
Sprinkle each with some sanding sugar for extra sweetness and top with strawberry hearts if desired.

In a food processor or strong blender, pulse the Oreos until they're finely chopped. Add the cream cheese and pulse until the entire mixture is creamed together.
30 Oreo cookies, 4 ounces low-fat cream cheese
Place the mixture in the refrigerator for 10-20 minutes, or until it is a bit firmer and cold.
Roll the truffle mixture into balls and place them on the baking sheet. (TIP: To help with this process, I sprayed my hands with nonstick spray. This helped in rolling without them being super sticky).
Place the truffles in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, until firm. After removing them from the refrigerator, you can re-roll them to make them more the shape you want if they have depressed at all.
Heat the white chocolate or almond bark in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time, stirring in between. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.
6 ounces white chocolate melting wafers
Dip each truffle into the white chocolate fully and then place it on the baking sheet again. Place in the refrigerator for another 20 minutes to set the chocolate/bark.
Heat the milk or dark chocolate in the microwave the same way as before, stirring in between and being careful not to burn.
5 ounces dark or milk chocolate melting wafers
Dip each side of each truffle into the chocolate, making the ""hair line"". If it works better you can use a fork for this part, dipping each side and then placing the truffle back on the wax paper.
Again let the truffles rest in the fridge for 20 minutes to set the chocolate.
Take each truffle and place a bit of icing on each side, where you want Leia's ""hair buns"" to go. Attach a Rolo to each side and place back on the wax paper.
¼ cup chocolate icing, 24 Rolo candies
Again allow them to sit in the refrigerator to set the icing. (tedious, but cuteness is upon us!)
Using edible markers, draw a face on each truffle. I did simple dots for eyes and a small heart for the mouth.

Let the steak sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before cooking
Prepare the grill and heat up about 30 minutes before cooking
Pat away extra moisture from the steak, and then season to your liking
Sear steaks until they lift without sticking to the grates
Turn your steaks over once and continue cooking
Use meat thermometer to check internal temperatures. A medium-rare steak should heat to about 140 F. Medium will be closer to 155 F and Well Done should be at a temperature of 165 F.
Remove the steaks from the grill when the thermometer reads about 5 degrees lower than you want it (the meat will continue cooking after removed from the grill).
