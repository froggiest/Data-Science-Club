The BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies,Sofi | Broma Bakery,"Jan 21, 2026",5,527,Cookies,20 minutes,11 minutes,NA,1 hour 31 minutes,NA,6,"Place the butter in a small saucepan and set over medium low heat. Low heat is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the butter from the bottom and sides of the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the butter will melt and foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook the butter, occasionally stirring and scraping with your spatula, until the butter begins to take on color and you see small floating brown bits, about 5 to 7 minutes (these are the milk solids in your butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is golden brown, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool in the saucepan for about 5 minutes. You want it to cool down enough that it’s pretty warm, but not scalding hot to the touch.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Use a silicone spatula to mix together. Add the egg, extra egg yolk, and vanilla and mix well.
Add in the flour, baking soda, salt and fold until no streaks of flour remain, being careful not to overmix your batter. The dough should be soft but not sticky, so when you touch it with your finger, it gives just a little. 
Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Do not over mix. Cover the bowl and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour (and up to overnight).
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to soften at room temperature until it’s scoopable (about 20 minutes).

Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies,Sofi | Broma Bakery,"Sep 17, 2025",5,1,Cookies,45 minutes,12 minutes,NA,2 hours,NA,7,"First, toast the walnuts. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the walnuts out into an even layer on the sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring the nuts halfway through. You’ll know they’re done when they’re lightly golden brown all over and smell toasty. Set aside to cool.
Next, brown the butter. Place the butter in a small saucepan and set over medium low heat. Low heat is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the butter from the bottom and sides of the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the butter will melt and foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook the butter, occasionally stirring and scraping with your spatula, until the butter begins to take on color and you see small floating brown bits, about 5 to 7 minutes (these are the milk solids in your butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is golden brown, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool in the saucepan for a few minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Use a silicone spatula to mix together. Add the egg, extra egg yolk, and vanilla and mix well.
Add in the flour, baking soda, salt and fold until no streaks of flour remain, being careful not to overmix your batter. The dough should be soft but not sticky, so when you touch it with your finger your finger doesn’t stick to the dough.
Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts until evenly distributed. Do not over mix. Cover the bowl and place it in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the bowl from the fridge and use a 1.5 ounce cookie scoop to scoop out your cookies. Place the cookie dough balls in a sealed container or on a cookie sheet wrapped in plastic wrap and place back in the fridge for at least another 30 minutes, but up to 24 hours!

The Best Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookies,Sofi | Broma Bakery,"Aug 6, 2025",4.8,24,Cookies,15 minutes,11 minutes,NA,1 hour,NA,6,"Place the butter in a small saucepan and set over medium low heat. Low heat is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the butter from the bottom and sides of the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the butter will melt and foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook the butter, occasionally stirring and scraping with your spatula, until the butter begins to take on color and you see small floating brown bits, about 5 to 7 minutes (these are the milk solids in your butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is golden brown, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool in the saucepan for a few minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Use a silicone spatula to mix together. Add the egg, extra egg yolk, and vanilla and mix well.
Add in the gluten free flour, baking soda, salt and fold until no streaks of flour remain, being careful not to overmix your batter. The dough should be soft but not sticky, so when you touch it with your finger, it gives just a little. 
Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Do not over mix. Cover the bowl and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour (and up to overnight).
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to soften at room temperature until it’s scoopable (about 20 minutes). Use a 1 ½ ounce cookie scoop to portion out equal amounts of dough. Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing the dough 2 inches apart. 
Bake until the cookies have puffed up and are light golden brown around the edges but still somewhat soft in the middle, 12 to 13 minutes.

Heat a small pot of water over medium-low heat until it steams. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine egg whites and a small amount of the 100 grams of Baker’s Corner Granulated Sugar (I usually take out about ¼ cup). Place bowl over steaming pot, creating a double boiler.
Whisk egg whites and Baker’s Corner Granulated Sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white and frothy, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and place the bowl back onto the stand mixer.
Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whisk on high speed while slowly adding in the remaining Baker’s Corner Granulated Sugar. Continue to whisk for another 3-4 minutes, until stiff meringue peaks form. Congratulations, you just made a Swiss meringue!
Next, sift together the Baker’s Corner Almond Flour, Baker’s Corner Powdered Sugar, and salt twice, then gently shake the mixture into the meringue bowl.
Place the bowl back onto a stand mixer, still fitted with a whisk attachment. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whisk for 5 seconds (just enough to combine the almond flour mixture with the egg whites).
Stop the mixer and use a large spatula to hand-mix the batter for the remainder of your mixing. You’ll want to gently fold the mixture with your spatula, scooping up the batter from the outside of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner. You’ll know to stop mixing when you can make a figure-eight out of the dripping batter without the batter breaking. If you cannot yet make a figure-eight, repeat the process if necessary, and try the figure-eight again. The best way to describe the perfect consistency is like slow moving lava. It should give, but only slightly, like in slow-motion.
Once your batter is the correct consistency, scoop it into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1-inch tip (you can also use a plastic bag and just snip off the end!). Pipe silver dollar-sized circles onto prepared baking sheets, keeping about 1.5 inches between each meringue. Bang baking sheet on counter two times to remove any air bubbles. Sprinkle the tops lightly with Benton’s Vanilla Wafer crumbs.

Scrape down the bowl and drop spoonfuls of the Specially Selected Strawberry Fruit Spread into the filling, using a rubber spatula to fold the frosting a few times to slightly distribute the jam. Don’t overmix–the jam will swirl into the frosting more as you pipe it onto the macarons.
Scoop the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch tip and set aside until ready to assemble the macarons.
Once the macarons are completely cool to the touch, pipe the filling onto the flat side of one macaron. Spread about a ½ teaspoon of Specially Selected Strawberry Fruit Spread on another macaron and sandwich together with the frosted one. Repeat with all macarons.

Heat a small pot of water over medium-low heat until it steams. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine egg whites and roughly 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Place bowl over steaming pot, creating a double boiler.
Whisk egg whites and sugar continuously until sugar melts completely and egg whites become white and frothy, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and place the bowl back onto the stand mixer.
Fit stand mixer with whisk attachment and whisk on high speed while slowly adding in the remaining granulated sugar. Add the food coloring (if using). Continue to whisk for another 3-4 minutes, until stiff meringue peaks form. Congratulations, you just made a Swiss meringue!
Next, sift together the almond flour, powdered sugar, and salt twice, then gently shake the mixture into the meringue bowl.
Place the bowl back onto a stand mixer, still fitted with a whisk attachment. Turn the mixer to medium speed and whisk for 5 seconds (just enough to combine the almond flour mixture with the egg whites).
Stop the mixer and use a large spatula to hand-mix the batter for the remainder of your mixing. You’ll want to gently fold the mixture with your spatula, scooping up the batter from the outside of the bowl and gently twisting it into the center in a circle-like manner. You’ll know to stop mixing when you can make a figure-eight out of the dripping batter without the batter breaking. If you cannot yet make a figure-eight, repeat the process if necessary, and try the figure-eight again. The best way to describe the perfect consistency is like slow moving lava. It should give, but only slightly, like in slow-motion.
Once your batter is the correct consistency, scoop it into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1 inch tip. Pipe silver dollar-sized circles onto prepared baking sheets, keeping about 1.5 inches between each meringue. Bang baking sheet on counter two times to remove any air bubbles. Sprinkle tops with a little sea salt as a garnish.
