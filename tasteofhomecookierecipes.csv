These are our Test Kitchen preferred chocolate chip brands. (Test Kitchen Tip: If your dough feels too thick or crumbly, add in a little more milk. Gluten-free flour tends to run a little drier than regular flour, so milk is added to keep the dough moist and prevent the cookies from getting chalky.)

Combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger and salt; stir into brown sugar mixture (mixture will be stiff). Transfer to a small bowl. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
   Trace <a href=""http://hostedmedia.reimanpub.com/TOH/Images/pdfs/45846_GingerbrdCottage.pdf"" target=""_blank"">patterns</a> onto waxed paper; cut out. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Position patterns on dough and cut out. Using a sharp knife, score outlines to mark windows and door where indicated on pattern, being careful not to cut all the way through dough. Using a toothpick, draw lines into dough to form bricks on all pieces except door area and roof. (Keep pieces covered to prevent them from drying out.)
   Transfer all cutouts to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 350° for 12-15 minutes or until browned. Immediately replace patterns on cutouts and cut around edges to trim excess. Cut out windows completely. Cool on pans for 2 minutes before carefully removing to wire racks to cool completely.
   Return front of house to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spoon 1 teaspoon crushed candies into each window cutout. Bake at 400° for 3-4 minutes or until candy is melted. Cool completely on baking sheet before removing.
   Tint water with desired amount of red food coloring. Using paintbrush, paint mixture over each piece except door area and roof; blot gently with paper towels and let dry.
   <b>To make icing:</b> In a large bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, meringue powder and cream of tartar. Add water; beat on low speed just until combined. Beat on high for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. Keep icing covered at all times with a damp cloth.
   <b>To assemble frame of house:</b> Working with a small amount of icing at a time, wipe icing over bricks using your fingertip. Immediately wipe gently with paper towels to remove excess.
   Place front of house on a flat surface. Tint a small amount of icing green and a small amount red. Cut a small hole in the corner of a pastry or plastic bag; insert #4 round pastry tip. Fill the bag with white icing. Pipe lines to trim door and windows, and to form windowpanes. For door knob, attach dragee with icing.
   Using a #14 star tip and green icing, pipe garland along windows and a wreath on door. Using a #2 round tip and red icing, pipe berries on garland and a bow and berries on wreath. Pipe additional details as desired; sprinkle immediately with glitter. Let dry completely.
   Pipe icing along base and one side of front of house and the adjoining side wall. Place walls at right angles to each other on cake circle; prop with small cans. Pipe icing along inside and outside edges for added stability. Repeat with second side section and back. Let dry completely.
