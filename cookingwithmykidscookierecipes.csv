Add the sugar, vanilla extract & egg to your bowl. 
Mix everything together with your hands until it comes together into a ball.
The first step in making these hidden heart biscuits is to make the heart centre.
Take around a third of the dough and add some red food colouring to it. Knead it until the colour is fully mixed in. Wrap the remaining plain dough in cling film and set it aside for now.
Sprinkle a little flour down on your work surface and roll the red dough out. 
Cut out hearts (around 3-4cm across) and stack them up on top of each other, pressing them together gently. Repeat this until you've used all the red dough, then wrap it in cling film and pop it in the freezer for a few hours.
Once the heart centres are hard, roll the plain dough out into three sausages then length of the heart column using your hands. Add a plain biscuit sausage to each side of the heart column, patting it down until you cover the hearts entirely. Gently roll the dough into a round cylinder.
Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 2+ hours.

Measure out the golden syrup and add that to your bowl.Crack the egg into a separate bowl before adding it to your mixing bowl just in case any shell goes in. 
Mix everything together until you have a smooth dough. We started with wooden spoons, then once it was less messy, brought it together with our hands. Squeeze it together so it stops crumbling apart, and makes a nice ball of gingerbread dough.
The recipe makes quite a lot of dough so you might find it easier to divide the dough in half. Set one half aside until later. Then, on a lightly floured work surface get your kids to roll the other half of dough out until it is about 5mm thick.Try to rotate your dough in between rolls – so roll it out in one direction, then pick it up, rotate it by 90 degrees before rolling it again. This should stop it sticking too badly. You can add a little more flour under the dough in between rolls.
Cut out your gingerbread reindeer using a man shaped or round cookie cutter. Place them on your baking tray. You can use a palette knife to help lift them on if you like.Gather up any scraps and roll out again. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Bake your cookies in the oven for about 10-12 minutes. They're ready when they become a slightly darker shade. Remove them from the oven and leave them to cool slightly on their baking trays then gently pop them on a wire rack to cool completely.
If you have icing writers you can use them to ice on the antlers, and add a little dot where the nose should go before sticking down the red Smartie/chocolate drop.
If you don't have icing writers, you can mix up a little of your own icing. Measure in the icing sugar, then add a teaspoon or so of water and mix it together. You want it to be runny enough to pipe but no so runny that it won't hold it's shape once you pipe it. If you need to keep adding a little more icing sugar or a little more water until it's just the right consistency.
Add the icing to a piping bag or small freezer bag, seal it and cut a tiny hole in the corner. Add a little dot of icing and use that to stick down the nose and eyes. You can also pipe on antlers. If your kids are little and find drawing the antlers too difficult, you could do that while they take charge of the eyes and red nose.

Pop the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes. They're ready when they are just starting to turn golden brown. Remove them from the oven and leave them to cool on a wire rack.
Break the chocolate into pieces and put them in a microwavable bowl. Melt them in short bursts in a microwave. If you don't have a microwave, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and put it over a pan of simmering water (a double boiler), stirring it until it melts.
While the chocolate is melting, choose your sprinkles and pour them into small bowls.
This works best if the melted chocolate is in a small bowl which makes the chocolate deeper as you can get more of the biscuit dipped.
Dip each biscuit in turn, into the chocolate. As soon as you've done that, sprinkle the sprinkles over the top of the chocolate.

Ice your party rings by drizzling the icing on with a spoon. We also tried making patterns with more than one colour – add a second colour on top and use a cocktail stick or something similar to spread it out into lines. To make the classic iced party ring drizzle the second colour across the biscuit in thin lines then draw the toothpick the other way.

Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract to your mixture, then weigh the flour in a separate bowl and sift it into your mixture. Once it’s all in give it another mix until it’s well combined.
Use your hands to finish mixing and press the dough together into a ball. To make the hedgehogs, break off little bits and roll them in your hands to form balls, then shape the snout/nose. Don’t worry too much about making them perfect, ours spread in the oven a little so I ended up doing it again a little after they had been baked. Put them on their baking tray with a little space between each one.
Put your baking tray in the oven for 10-12 minutes until they are golden brown. Remove from the oven and put them on a wire rack to cool (you might want to reshape the noses a little before they cool).

Use something pointy like a chopstick or cocktail stick to dip in the chocolate and form the eyes and nose.",8,250 g butter softened,140 g caster sugar,1 egg yolk,2 tsp vanilla extract,300 g plain flour,For the topping,150 g chocolate,Cooking With My Kids,https://www.cookingwithmykids.co.uk/hedgehog-biscuits/,Chocolate sprinkles or crushed nuts walnuts,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
