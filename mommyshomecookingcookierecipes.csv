Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer over medium speed, beat the cold butter for 30-45 seconds to break it down a little. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cream cheese; mix until just combined, about 30-45 seconds. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add chocolate chips and mix to distribute evenly.
Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture; mix until it resembles coarse crumbs. Then, add the milk and vanilla; mix until just combined (don't overmix!).
Scoop dough out a slightly heaping teaspoon at a time and drop it onto a plate or baking sheet. Shape each into a ball, then if desired, press 3 – 4 more chocolate chips into the top (totally optional, mostly for looks). Freeze for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 months.Tip: Use a small cookie scoop to portion out the dough.
Preheat the oven to 350º F (180º C). Line two large-rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Place the frozen cookie balls at least 1″ apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in a preheated oven for about 10 – 12 minutes (they should still fill soft and slightly under-baked; they will continue to cook slightly once removed from the oven, so carefully do not over-bake).Important: Every oven is different, so baking times must always be taken with a grain of salt. Oven thermostats can be wildly off,and that will all affect baking time, so keep an eye on yours. Your mini cookies are done, when the edges are very lightly browned. The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool.

Add the milk and vanilla extract and whisk until well combined. The mixture will look thin at this point; that’s okay. Let it rest for about 5 minutes to cool slightly.
Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cornstarch using a large spoon or spatula. The dough will be thick, soft, and slightly shiny.
Transfer half of the dough to a separate bowl. Each portion will weigh 480 g approximately.
Gently mix in 1 cup of chocolate chunks or chips to one half, making sure the dough isn’t too warm; mix until evenly distributed.Important: Make sure the dough is not too warm before adding the chocolate, or it may melt and streak into the dough instead of staying in chunks. Keep mixing gently until everything comes together and the chocolate is evenly distributed.
To the other half of the dough, add cocoa powder and extra milk; mix until fully combined. Then, mix in 1 cup of chocolate chunks or chips; mix until evenly distributed and no dry spots remain.
Portion each dough into 2 tablespoons (50 g approx.) Tip: You can make smaller cookies if you prefer.

Place one piece of dough on a large sheet of parchment paper. Place another sheet on top to prevent sticking. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
Place both rolled-out doughs, one on top of the other, on a baking tray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.
Preheat the oven to 350º F (180º C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Working with one sheet of dough at a time, use a cookie cutter to cut into tree shapes. Transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart.
Bake the cut-out cookies for 10–13 minutes or until the edges are just starting to turn lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let them sit on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Gather up the dough scraps, press them into a disk, roll out, and refrigerate for 15–20 minutes before cutting and baking again.
In a medium bowl, mix the confectioners’ sugar and water until smooth and no lumps remain. You can do this by hand, but a mixer makes the process easier. Add the light corn syrup and mix until incorporated.
Check the consistency: drag the tip of a butter knife across the surface of the icing. If the line takes 8–10 seconds to disappear, it’s ready. If it’s too thick, add water 1 teaspoon at a time. If it’s too thin, add a little more sifted confectioners’ sugar until it reaches the consistency you need.Tip: To prevent crusting, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the icing and keep it covered until you’re ready to use it.
Once the cookies are completely cooled, transfer about 1/3 cup of the icing to a small bowl and tint it with 1–2 drops of green gel food coloring. Mix until the color is fully incorporated. Place the green icing in a small piping bag and seal the top.
Pour the remaining uncolored icing into a slightly wider bowl for dipping.
Cut a small opening (about 1/4 inch) in the piping bag. Drizzle the green icing over the surface of the white icing. Use a toothpick or scribe tool to gently drag lines through the icing to create a swirled, marbled pattern.
Dip each cookie face-down into the icing, covering the surface completely. Lift, let the excess drip off, then turn the cookie right-side up and place it on a wire rack or parchment to dry.
Lift, let the excess drip off, then turn the cookie right-side up and place it on a wire rack or parchment to dry.
Tip: If desired, add sparkly sprinkles right after dipping to resemble Christmas lights.

Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer, beat the butter, sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, and salt at medium speed until smooth and creamy, for 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
Reduce the speed to low, and add the flour mixture; beat just until incorporated, and the dough starts to come together.
Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Place one piece of dough on a big piece of parchment paper (or a silicone mat) and slightly flatten it with your hands. Place another piece of parchment on top to prevent sticking. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness (6mm). Repeat with the second piece of dough.
Place both rolled-out doughs, one on top of the other, on a baking tray and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.Tip: Cover the tray with plastic wrap if you plan to refrigerate the dough for over 2 hours.
When ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Working with one dough sheet at a time, use a round cookie cutter (I used a 2.5-inch – 5.7 cm round cookie cutter) to cut the dough into shapes. Transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. Gather up the dough scraps and form them into a disk, re-roll the remaining dough, and continue cutting until all is used.
Bake the cut-out cookies for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are just set at the edges. Remove from the oven and let them sit on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Then, use a wide metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let them cool completely.
Melt the chopped white chocolate and oil in the microwave in 15-second increments, stopping and stirring after each until completely smooth. Add another drop of oil to thin out if needed.
After melting, stir in 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract. Taste. Add 1/4 teaspoon more if desired. I recommend using 3/4 teaspoon of peppermint extract because once the white chocolate sets, the peppermint flavor tends to mellow out and won’t be as pronounced.
Drop one cookie into the melted white chocolate mixture. Using a 2- or 3-pronged candy dipping tool, gently flip the cookie to ensure it's fully coated on all sides. Lift the cookie out, letting the excess white chocolate drip off by lightly tapping the tool against the side of the bowl.
Carefully slide the coated cookie onto the prepared lined baking sheet and sprinkle it with crushed candy canes. Repeat the process with the remaining cookies.Tip: After dipping the cookies in melted white chocolate, allow them to cool and set them on parchment paper at room temperature.

Then use a wide metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat the process to cut and bake the remaining dough.
Place the butter in a light-colored skillet. Melt the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring. After 5–8 minutes, the butter will begin browning—you’ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan, and it will have a nutty aroma. Once browned, immediately remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. 
After 5 minutes, whisk in the remaining icing ingredients until smooth. Let the icing cool for 5 – 10 minutes; it will thicken a bit as it cools.

Easy Marshmallow Rice Crispy Cookies (Costco Copycat – Egg-Free),Oriana Romero,5,1,American,Dessert,Cookies,10 minutes,12 minutes,NA,22 minutes,12 cookies,8,"Spread them out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and pop them in the freezer for about 20 minutes while you make the cookie dough.
Set your oven to 325º F (165º C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Keep cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until it turns golden brown and smells nutty. Immediately pour the browned butter into a small bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature.Pro Tip: Keep a close eye—the butter can go from beautifully brown to burned in seconds.
Once the butter has cooled, stir in the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla with a spatula until everything comes together and looks a little fluffy. Add the milk and mix until smooth.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry mixture to the butter mixture and fold until most of the flour is incorporated. Keep folding until everything is evenly combined. Stir in the crispy rice cereal and ¾ cup (38 g) of the frozen marshmallows, making sure they’re well distributed.
Use a 3 tablespoons (1 ½-oz) cookie scoop to portion the dough. Roll each portion into a ball, then place them on the prepared baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Gently press two more frozen marshmallows on top of each dough ball, tucking them slightly under the dough or pushing the dough up around them to prevent burning or oozing. 
Lightly flatten the dough balls with your hand so they spread nicely.

Thick & Chewy Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookies Made in One Bowl,Oriana Romero,5,4,American,Dessert,Cookies,10 minutes,10 minutes,Chilling Time 2 hours hrs,20 minutes,18 – 20 cookies,9,"In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and salt until smooth and no lumps remain. 
Add the milk, vanilla, and salt, and whisk until well combined. The mixture will look thin at this point—that’s okay. Let it rest for about 5 minutes to cool slightly.
Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cornstarch using a large spoon or spatula. The dough will be thick, soft, and a little shiny. 
Gently fold in the chocolate chunks or chips. Because the butter is melted, the chocolate may not want to stick to the dough right away, but keep mixing, and it’ll come together.Tip: Make sure the dough isn’t too warm when you stir in the chocolate—otherwise, it can start to melt and streak through the batter instead of staying in nice chunks or chips.
Scoop the dough using a cookie scoop—about 3 tablespoons (2 oz / 60 g) for XL cookies or 2 tablespoons (1.75 oz / 50 g) for medium-large cookies. Roll into balls, then shape them slightly taller than wide, almost like a cylinder. This little trick helps the cookies bake up thicker. Place the cookie balls on a baking sheet or large plate.
Refrigerate the dough balls for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.  
Place the cookie dough balls you want to bake on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart so they have room to spread. 
Bake for 9–11 minutes, until the edges are golden and the centers look soft and puffy. Don’t over-bake—these cookies will continue to set as they cool. Leave them on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a rack. If you’d like, press a few extra chocolate chips on top while the cookies are still warm for that bakery-style look.Tip: Right after taking them out of the oven, firmly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2–3 times to give the cookies that crinkly, rippled look.

Add the cream cheese and vanilla; mix until incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture; beat just until incorporated, and the dough starts to come together. Divide the dough into two equal pieces.
Place one piece of dough on a big piece of parchment paper. Place another piece of parchment on top to prevent sticking. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4 (6 mm) thick. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
For one-half the dough, sprinkle on an even generous layer of red sanding sugar and use the rolling pin to roll the sprinkles into the dough.
Place both rolled-out doughs, one on top of the other, on a baking tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
Once the dough has chilled, use a ruler and a sharp knife (or pizza cutter) to cut ½ inch strips of dough. Return to the fridge while you work on the other half.
Carefully arrange the strips side by side, alternating colors, and make sure they are touching. When you have a stripe pattern, use a rolling pin to gently roll the striped lined dough pieces together (so the stripes stick to each other again). Transfer to the fridge to chill for 5 – 20 minutes.

Use smaller circle cutters to use as much of the dough as possible, then ball up the rest, roll it out, and have some crazy-looking but tasty scrap cookies.

In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer, beat butter until creamy and pale on medium-high speed, about 3 – 4 minutes. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed and pale, scraping down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Then add evaporated milk and vanilla; continue beating to combine for about 1 minute.
Turn the mixer to low and add the flour mixture; beat until just combined, about 30 – 45 seconds. Then add the milk; mix until well combined. Do not overmix.
Scoop dough into two teaspoon-sized scoops and drop onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing cookies at least 2” (5cm) apart. You should be able to fit all the cookies on the two baking sheets. Note: if you don't have a small cookie dough scoop (https://amzn.to/3zwwKcr ), you can place the dough in a piping bag fitted with a medium round pastry tip. Pipe it in even mounds onto a cookie sheet (roughly 2 teaspoons).
Once all the batter has been scooped or piped, dip your fingers in some water and lightly press down on the top of each cookie to create a smooth surface.
Bake the cookies for 13 – 15 minutes, until the edges are browned. I recommend rotating the pans halfway through the bake time to ensure even browning. Note: For cookies that remain somewhat soft in the center, aim for light browning around the edges. If you’d like a crispier cookie, bake a bit longer until the edges are golden brown.
Cool on pan 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up 5 days.

Mix flour and cornstarch in a bowl. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture; mix until just barely combined.
On medium speed, beat in 4 tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able, but still thick. If the dough is not pipe-able enough, add more milk 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need up to 2 extra tablespoons of milk).
Place the dough in a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. 
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Pipe the dough in 1- to 2-inch (3- to 5 cm) swirls 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Chill the shaped cookies on the baking sheets for 20 to 30 minutes.

Reduce speed to low and add in flour mixture; mix until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Whisk milk, vanilla extract, and pumpkin puree in a bowl until smooth. Reduce the mixer’s speed to low and add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients; mix until the dough just comes together, about 1 – 2 minutes. The dough will look like big chunky nuggets. Be careful not to overmix.  
For Big Bakery-Style Cookies: Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, about 90 grams each. Form rustic balls of dough and then make a crater in the center of the dough with your thumb.For Smaller Cookies: Divide the dough into 18 equal portions, about 60 grams each. Form rustic balls of dough and make a crater in the center with your thumb. 
Remove a single scoop of cheesecake mixture from your freezer and gently press it into the crater you just created in the center of the cookie ball. Form the dough into a ball around the cheesecake, concealing the cheesecake filling in the center of the cookie. Make sure there are no cracks, and no filling is visible. This is important because you just want to make sure the filling can't ""escape"" (you can add a bit more dough if needed!). Repeat with the rest of the cookie balls.
Mix the coating ingredients together, and then roll each cookie dough ball generously in the cinnamon-sugar coating.

Make sure you have enough space in your fridge to chill the ladyfinger before baking. 
If you are using Eggless Ladyfingers to make Tiramisu, I highly recommend making the cookies the day before and letting them dry out at room temperature overnight, so they have the perfect texture to dip into the coffee.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with the whisk attachment), beat on medium-high speed aquafaba and cream of tartar, until the mixture becomes foamy and the mixture becomes opaque. Continue beating until reach medium peaks.
Gradually add half of the sugar (120 g) about 1 teaspoon at a time, or just sprinkle it in slow as slow can be, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
Increase the speed of your mixer to the max. Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume. The mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved. To know more details about how to whip aquafaba click here.
Mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter and the other half (120 g) of sugar until creamy and pale on medium-high speed. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add vanilla and mix to combine.
Reduce speed to low and mix half of the flour mixture until just combined. Add milk in three additions, scraping down the mixing bowl with a spatula, and turn the batter over several times to ensure all of the ingredients are well incorporated. Add the remaining half of the flour; beat just until combined. Do not overmix the batter.
Using a large spoon or spatula, gently fold in the whipped aquafaba into the batter, taking care not to deflate all of the air you have incorporated.
Transfer the batter to a piping bag with a 1/2-inch round tip.
Pipe 3-inch lines of batter about 1 inch apart onto the parchment paper. Refrigerate the pipped ladyfingers for 20 – 30 minutes.

Brush the scones with heavy cream and bake for about 18 to 20 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool down completely on a wire rack.
Prepare the vanilla glaze: Mix the ingredients in a small bowl until smooth.
