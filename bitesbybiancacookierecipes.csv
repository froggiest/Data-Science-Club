In a large bowl, use fingers to massage ½ cup granulated sugar, ⅓ cup light or dark brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon lemon zest until fragrant. This releases the oils from the zest, enhancing the lemon flavor in the cookies.
Using your silicone spatula, stir in melted ½ cup unsalted butter until smooth.
Add 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Mix until combined.
Dump in 1 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds and all of the dry ingredients. Mix until no dry spots remain.
Plop large random blobs of lemon curd on top of your dough. Very lightly stir this into your cookie dough. Try to keep some streaks of lemon curd in it.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper.
For regular cookies, use medium cookie scoop to gather 2-3 tablespoons of dough into a ball. Place on lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 3-4 inches apart.
For chick design, add two ~½ tsp balls of dough (make one slightly larger than the other) on top of each cookie dough ball. These will be the tufts of hair.
Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until edges are set and golden brown. Let cool on pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cool completely.

Dye any remaining orange food coloring with red oil-based food coloring. Use this for the blush.

Repeat with remaining dough, shaping them into regular balls or bears!
Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until edges are set/firm. Middles should look slightly underbaked. But don't worry—they will finish baking on the cookie sheet while the pan is still hot!

Browning butter can go from 0 to 100 reaaally quickly, aka it's easy to burn it if you keep your eyes off of it.
So, have the bowl handy so you can transfer the finished brown butter to it ASAP.
Add all of the sliced butter into your pan over a stovetop. Turn the heat to medium and stir frequently with your silicone spatula.
First, the butter will melt, then it will start to foam. Soon, the bubbles will subside and brown bits will start to form at the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring, often scraping the bottom, until the butter is deep golden brown and there are a bunch of brown specks. It should smell nutty, toasty, and sweet.
Immediately transfer the brown butter to your heatproof bowl. This prevents the butter from continuing to cook in the pan and burn.
Depending on the recipe you are using the brown butter for, you can use it immediately, let it cool, or refrigerate/freeze for later use.",1,▢ 8 tablespoons (113 g) butter cut into tablespoons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bites By Bianca,https://bitesbybianca.com/easy-brown-butter-recipe/

Place oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F/177°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper/silicone mat.
Use a medium cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 2-3 tablespoons each) and plop onto lined baking tray, about 3-4 inches apart.
For the ears, place 1 tsp dough balls on top left and right sides of each cookie.
Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until edges are set and golden brown. Let cool on pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack.
Optional: For rounder bears, use a silicone spatula to push the edges around of your freshly baked, warm cookies. This will only work when the cookies are still hot.
Note: You can a piping bag, toothpick, or cookie scribe to add on the details. I used piping bags. For the following steps, I use this one-bowl method to make the icing to limit how many dishes I need to clean! I started off with lighter colors and end with black.
In a small bowl, add 4 tbsp powdered sugar. Add ¼ tsp water at a time, mixing until you get a pipeable consistency. You may need up to 2 ½ tsp of water.
If it's too liquidy, add more powdered sugar. If it's too stiff, add more water.
Pour half of the mixture into a piping bag. This will be the white color for the snout and ears.
To the remaining icing, add a drop of pink or red food coloring. Mix until combined, then add half of this mixture to another piping bag. This will be the blush.
To the rest of the icing, add black food coloring. Mix until combined, then transfer all of the icing to another piping bag. This will be for the nose and eyes.
Snip the very ends of the piping bags. First, pipe the snouts and ears using the white icing. Once the snouts are semi-dry, pipe the noses and eyes using the black icing. Finish with the pink icing for the blush.

Ube Marshmallow Cookies,Bianca Fernandez,"February 24, 2022",5,6,Dessert,Filipino,Dessert,15 minutes,20 minutes,NA,5 minutes,8 cookies,11,"In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt.
In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (can alternatively use hand mixer or whisk), mix the butter, ube halaya, and sugars on medium speed until combined.
Scrape bottom of bowl. Add ube extract and egg, then mix again.
Fold in all of the dry ingredients using a rubber spatula. Cover the dough and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. This reduces the cookies from spreading and enhances the flavor.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Use large cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 3 tablespoon each). Shape dough into ball, then place onto lined baking tray. Slightly flatten with palm of your hand or bottom of a cup.
Bake for 11-13 minutes. Cookies should look slightly puffy and soft in the center with firm, set edges. They will not brown because of the purple color.
Let cool on pan for about 15 minutes. Cooling the cookies before adding the marshmallows helps the marshmallows keep their shape and not completely melt into a puddle due to the heat.
Once the cookies are mostly cooled, turn on your broiler (can alternatively use a kitchen blowtorch). Place one ube marshmallow on top of each cookie, then broil/blowtorch until the marshmallow is roasted to your liking. If using a broiler, this will take about 1 minute. Keep an eye on them and be careful to not burn them. Remove cookies from broiler and sprinkle flaky sea salt on top.
Let marshmallow cool for 10-15 minutes. If eaten ASAP, the marshmallow will be a gooey mess, unless you prefer it that way. Cooling allows the ube marshmallow to set and have a bit of a stretch when you pull it apart, like in my video.

Place silicone baking mats or parchment paper on top of templates.
Set up one large piping bag. You don't need a piping tip, you can just snip the end of the bag later.
In a medium bowl, mix the sifted almond flour and powdered sugar. Instead of sifting, you can also put the ingredients in a food processor and blend for <10 seconds until you get a fine powder.
In a small bowl, add the granulated sugar.
Pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer. Set up a stopwatch to time how long to whip the meringue. (These times are listed to help beginner macaron makers. With practice, you can go by eye.)
0:00 – 4:00 minutes: Mix on medium-low for 4 minutes (Kitchenaid speed 4).
4:00 – 9:30 minutes: Turn the mixer to medium speed (Kitchenaid speed 6). Add a third of the granulated sugar. After 30 seconds, add another third. After another 30 seconds, add the last of the granulated sugar. Add ube extract. Keep mixing at medium speed until you have reached a total of 9:30 minutes.
The meringue should be balled up onto the whisk, very thick, glossy, and have stiff peaks. If not, keep mixing at 30-second intervals at Kitchenaid speed 8 until it is.
Add all of the powdered sugar and almond flour. Add more purple food coloring as needed.
Using a rubber spatula, fold until the batter ribbons off of the spatula. To test if it is ready, allow the batter to flow off the spatula and into the batter. If the ribbons do not melt into the rest of the batter after 30 seconds, continue folding. Be careful not to over mix or the macarons will not bake well. When it passes this test, transfer it to your piping bag.
Snip off a medium-large tip using scissors.
Using the Lumpy Space Princess macaron template as a guide, pipe macarons onto your silicone mats/parchment paper. Make sure not to pipe all the way to the edges, since the batter will begin to settle and spread out just a bit.
Tip: I like to pipe one pair of shells at a time, then go in with a toothpick or cookie scribe to move the batter along to my liking and pop any air bubbles.
Remove the templates from underneath the macarons. Allow the macarons to sit out at room temperature to dry for at least 1 hour. They will be ready to bake once the surface of the macaron is matte and dry to the touch. If it is a really humid day, it can sometimes take 2+ hours for them to dry.
Preheat the oven to 325F. Place an empty baking sheet upside-down on the middle rack.
Place the baking sheet with the macarons on top of the upside-down baking sheet. Bake one tray at a time for 15-20 minutes, rotating halfway through.
To test if they are done baking, gently push the side of one shell. If it wiggles on the sheet, they need to be baked longer.
Remove the tray and place it on a wire rack. Bake any remaining macaron shells.
Allow macarons to fully cool before peeling them off the parchment paper or silicone mats, about 15 minutes.
Add ube halaya into a small piping bag and set aside. Alternatively, you can spoon the filling in the center later on.
In a mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, ube extract, and powdered sugar until smooth using a whisk, handmixer, or paddle attachment of a stand mixer.
Transfer filling to a piping bag.
*You don’t have to fit the piping bag with a tip, but I chose to fit mine with an open star tip.
Match the macaron shells, lining up each pair on your work surface.
Outline LSP's body and draw on different faces using the black edible marker. If drawing an open mouth, you can color the inside with purple if you'd like!
Dye white chocolate yellow using oil-based food coloring.
*When dying white chocolate, you’ll want to use oil-based food coloring or the chocolate will seize up and become lumpy. However, if you don’t have oil-based food coloring, you can try mixing in a tsp of neutral oil (canola, vegetable) at a time! The chocolate should come back together. Maaagic.
Transfer the yellow chocolate to a small piping bag. Snip a small tip, then pipe on LSP's star. Alternatively, you can use a cookie scribe or toothpick.
Pipe a ring of ube cream cheese frosting on the bottom shell, then fill the middle with ube halaya. Add the other shell on top.
Leave macarons in an airtight container in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours before eating. This allows them to mature, making them softer, chewier, and more flavorful. Eat at room temperature.
*Maturation time is usually overnight, but cheesecake fillings are very moist and mature the shells quickly.

Mix in 1 tbsp vanilla paste, 1 tbsp matcha powder (sifted), 1 egg until smooth.
Dump in all of the dry ingredients. Fold using silicone spatula until no dry spots remains.
Now, you will make a ""parchment stack"". The bottom layer will be a large piece of parchment paper, the cookie dough in the middle, then parchment paper on top. This will make rolling out the dough much easier + mess free.
Lay large piece of parchment paper down on work surface. Plop on all of the cookie dough, then lay another piece of parchment on top of it. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large rectangle, until dough is about ¼-inch thick.
Transfer parchment stack to a baking tray and freeze for about 15 minutes. This will make cutting out shapes easier.
Preheat the oven to 350°F/177°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
This step will help loosen the shortbread from the parchment paper layers. So when you cut out dough pieces, the dough doesn't stick to the paper and is easier to transfer to your lined baking tray.
Peel off top parchment paper, then lightly stick it back on. Flip the entire parchment-cookie dough-parchment stack over so you can completely peel off the bottom parchment paper.
Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Transfer cookies to baking sheets, about 2-3 inches apart. The cookies will not spread much while baking.
Tip: Lightly flour your cookie cutter to minimize any sticking. When transferring cut-out cookies to your lined baking sheet, you can slide an offset spatula underneath the cookie to easily pick it up.

The meringue should be balled up onto the whisk, very thick, glossy, and have stiff peaks. If not, keep mixing at 30-second intervals at Kitchenaid speed 8 until it is.
Dump in all of the powdered sugar + almond flour to the meringue. Gently fold the macaron batter, often scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add more food coloring if you want a deeper color.
Fold the batter until it reaches a thick, glossy consistency and flows off the rubber spatula into ribbons. To test if it is ready, allow the batter to flow off the spatula and into the batter. If the ribbons do not melt into the rest of the batter after 30 seconds, continue folding. Be careful not to over mix. When it passes this test, transfer the batter to your piping bag.
Pipe about 16 round shells onto your silicone mats/parchment paper, using the macaron template as a guide.
Tap the trays against the counter a few times to get rid of air bubbles. If there are bubbles on the surface, you can use a toothpick or cookie scribe to pop them. Popping the air bubbles helps stop them from cracking when being baked.
Allow the macarons to sit out at room temperature to dry for at least one hour. They will be ready to bake once the surface of the macaron is matte and dry to the touch. If it is a really humid day, it can sometimes take 2 hours for them to dry.
Preheat the oven to 325F. Place an empty baking sheet upside-down on the middle rack.
Place the baking sheet with the macarons on top of the upside-down baking sheet. The upside-down sheet will help the macarons bake more evenly, decreasing the chances of cracking.
Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate. Drop the oven temp to 310F (to prevent browning), and bake for 5-10 more minutes. To test if they are done baking, gently push the side of one shell. If it wiggles on the sheet, they need to be baked longer.
Remove the macarons and place them on a wire rack. Bake any remaining macaron shells.
Allow macarons to fully cool before peeling them off the parchment paper or silicone mats.
In a medium-large mixing bowl, whip the cream cheese until smooth. Whisk in the heavy cream until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.
Mix in the roasted matcha powder until combined.
Taste test the filling! If it is too tart, add 1 tbsp powdered sugar at a time. Make sure not to overmix, or the filling will become too loose. If it does become too loose, whip in a small splash of heavy cream until it fluffs up again.
Transfer filling to a piping bag and snip a medium tip.
Match the macaron shells, lining up each pair on your work surface.
For the details, you can use a toothpick, cookie scribe, or piping bag.
Use about 4 tbsp of melted white chocolate to add the eyeballs and horns. Save any extra for the white sparkle on Mike's eyes later.

Frog Matcha White Chocolate Macarons,Bianca Fernandez,"March 30, 2022_March 20, 2024",5,5,Macarons,"Asian, French",Dessert,30 minutes,20 minutes,NA,50 minutes,12 macarons,21,"Put printed macaron template on baking trays. Place silicone baking mats or parchment paper on top of templates.
Set up one medium piping bag with a medium round tip and one small piping bag with a small round tip. If you do not have a round tips, you can just snip the end of the bags before piping.
In a medium bowl, mix the sifted almond flour, powdered sugar, and matcha powder.
In a small bowl, combine granulated sugar and cream of tartar.
Pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer. Set up a stopwatch to time how long to whip the meringue. (These times are listed to help beginner macaron makers. With practice, you can go by eye.)
0:00 – 4:00 minutes: Mix on medium-low for 4 minutes (Kitchenaid speed 4).
4:00 – 9:30 minutes: Turn the mixer to medium speed (Kitchenaid speed 6). Add a third of the granulated sugar and cream of tartar mixture. After 30 seconds, add another third. After another 30 seconds, add the last of the granulated sugar and cream of tartar mixture. Keep mixing at medium speed until you have reached a total of 9:30 minutes.
The meringue should be balled up onto the whisk, very thick, glossy, and have stiff peaks. If not, keep mixing at 30-second intervals at Kitchenaid speed 8 until it is.
Add all of the powdered sugar, almond flour, matcha, and green food coloring to the meringue. Gently fold the macaron batter, often scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Continue folding, adding more green food coloring as needed.
Fold the batter until it reaches a thick, glossy consistency and flows off the rubber spatula into ribbons. To test if it is ready, allow the batter to flow off the spatula and into the batter. If the ribbons do not melt into the rest of the batter after 30 seconds, continue folding. Be careful not to over mix. When it passes this test, transfer a little more than 3/4 of the batter to your medium piping bag, and the remaining to your small piping bag.
With your medium piping bag, pipe round shells onto your silicone mats/parchment paper, using the round macaron template as a guide. Tap the trays against the counter a few times to get rid of air bubbles. If there are bubbles on the surface, you can use a toothpick or cookie scribe to pop them. Popping the air bubbles helps stop them from cracking when being baked.
Once you get rid of as many air bubbles as possible, you will now pipe the eyes using the smaller tipped bag. You can pipe eyes on half of the macaron shells or all of them—it is your preference. Using the small piping bag, pipe a small circle on the top left of on of the shells to make one of the eyes. Repeat on the top right side for the other eye. Remove templates.
Allow the macarons to sit out at room temperature to dry for at least one hour. They will be ready to bake once the surface of the macaron is matte and dry to the touch. If it is a really humid day, it can sometimes take 2 hours for them to dry.
Preheat the oven to 325F. Place an empty baking sheet upside-down on the middle rack.
Place the baking sheet with the macarons on top of the upside-down baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, rotating halfway through. To test if they are done baking, gently push the side of one shell. If it wiggles on the sheet, they need to be baked longer.
Remove the macarons and place them on a wire rack. Bake any remaining macaron shells.
Allow macarons to fully cool before peeling them off the parchment paper or silicone mats.
Add white chocolate and heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave for 45 seconds, then mix. If the chocolate is not fully melted, microwave at 10-second intervals and mix until it is smooth.
Mix in the sifted matcha powder.
Place bowl into the fridge and stir it every 5 minutes until the ganache is thick enough to pipe, about 15-20 minutes. Transfer ganache to a piping bag.
Match the macaron shells, lining up each pair on your work surface. If you're using royal icing, pipe on black dots for the eyes and pink for the blush. Draw in the smile using an edible market.
Alternatively, you can only use edible markers or even melted milk/dark chocolate for the eyes and smile, and melted white chocolate dyed pink. It is up to you!
Pipe a dollop of the matcha white chocolate ganache on the bottom shell, then add the other shell on top.

Dump in all of the dry ingredients and mix until no dry spots remain. Cover the dough and let it rest in the fridge for 20-30 minutes. This will let the flour hydrate and let the butter cool, yielding chewier cookies.
You can skip ahead during this time to make the chocolate ganache.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Use small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Roll into a ball and shape onto lined baking tray. Using your fingers, shape the ball of dough into a teardrop/pear (see picture in post for reference).
Place avocados about 3-4 inches apart.
Bake for 10-13 minutes. Cookies should look slightly puffy and soft in the center, in addition to retaining their green color. The edges should be set/firm, slightly browned.
As soon as you remove the cookies from the oven, use the back of a metal teaspoon/tablespoon to create a circular indent. The ganache will later go in the indent to create the ""avocado seed"".
If you want, you can also shape the edges by pushing them with rubber spatula to get a more perfect avocado shape.

*Tip: If the dough cracks on the sides, you can use your fingers to smooth it out.
For the frog eyes, take about 1 tsp of dough and split it into two equally sized balls. Firmly place them on top of the frog heads, using water as glue. Make sure the doughs are completely touching.
Use your finger to completely smooth out the sides where the doughs meet. This ensures the eyes don't fall off after baking.

Use small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Shape dough into ball, then place onto lined baking tray. Flatten with palm of your hand or bottom of a cup. This will be the cat's head.
For the ears, take ½ tsp of dough and shape into a triangle with your fingers Place the ear on the upper left or right side of the head and repeat for the other ear. Place cats about 3-4 inches apart. They will not spread much while baking.

Be careful to not over bake so they don't get crispy! They will continue cooking when cooling on the pan.
Let cool on pan for about 5-10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cool completely.
To add the faces, use pink, yellow, and black colored vegan royal icing (recipe in notes below). Place into small piping bags and cut a small tip for each one. Have a toothpick or cookie scribe on hand to help you move the icing in the direction you want as you decorate the cookies.
First, start with the eyes using the yellow royal icing: outline the eyes by piping 4 dots that you can connect into a circle. After connecting the circle for each eye, move onto the next cat. This allows the yellow outlines to somewhat dry, allowing you to flood the middle with the remaining yellow icing.
After piping the eye outlines for each cat, flood the circles with the yellow icing. While that dries, use the pink royal icing to add the noses and inner ears for each cat.
Take black icing and pipe whiskers on the left and right sides of the cat's face. Finally, using the black icing, add the pupils to the cat's eyes within the yellow circle. Leave a small perimeter of the yellow around the pupils as pictured in my photos.

Scrape bottom of bowl.
Add in the egg and vanilla. Stir until combined.
Sift in all of the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt, mixing until no dry spots remain.
Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This will help the dough firm up and will be easier to roll out later.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Now, you will make a ""parchment stack"". The bottom layer will be a large piece of parchment paper, the cookie dough in the middle, then parchment paper on top. This will make rolling out the dough much easier + mess free.
Lay large piece of parchment paper down on work surface. Plop on all of the cookie dough, then lay another piece of parchment on top of it.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large rectangle, until dough reaches desired thickness. I rolled my dough out to a little under half an inch thick.
If sheet of dough becomes too soft to work with, pop it in the freezer for 15 minutes.
This step will help loosen the shortbread from the parchment paper layers. So when you cut out dough pieces, the dough doesn't stick to the paper and is easier to transfer to your lined baking tray.
Peel off top parchment paper, then lightly stick it back on. Flip the entire parchment-shortbread-parchment stack over so you can peel off the bottom parchment paper.
Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. If you'd like to copy the Domo design, use a knife to cut out even squares.
Transfer cookies to baking sheets, about 2-3 inches apart. The cookies will not spread much while baking. Using a fork, poke 3 rows of holes in each shortbread.
This will help the shortbread bake evenly and flat, so it doesn't puff up in the oven.
Bake for 10-12 minutes. Cookies should have slightly firm edges and look set (no wet/underbaked spots in dough).
Let cool on pan for about 5-10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Match the shortbread cookies in pairs and line them up.

For regular Cadbury cookies, use small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Place on lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 3-4 inches apart. Top with a few extra crushed Cadbury eggs.
For bunny cookies, use small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Shape into a ball place onto lined baking tray. This will be the bunny's head. For the ears, take about ¾ tsp of dough, shape into ball, and equally split it into two. Roll the balls into about 1.25-inch logs, and place on the top sides of the heads. Make sure they are somewhat thin and spaced out, so they don't connect when baking.
Bake cookies for 11-13 minutes, or until edges are set. Cookies should be golden brown and middles should look very slightly underbaked. But don't worry—they will finish baking on the cookie sheet while cooling!
Optional: For rounder, more aesthetic cookies, take a something circular (cookie cutter, mug, cup) and larger than your cookies, and place it on top of a warm, freshly baked cookie. Move the circular object around to shape the edges of the cookie until it becomes rounder. Then, top with a few more crushed Cadbury eggs as needed.
For the bunny cookies, you can use a silicone spatula to gently shape head and ears to your liking.
Let cool on pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Bake any remaining cookies.

In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (can alternatively use an electric mixer or whisk), cream the ½ cup softened butter and ½ cup sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 1-2 minutes. Scrape bottom of bowl using rubber spatula.
Add 1 tsp vanilla extract + egg. Mix until smooth.
Stir in 4 tbsp cocoa powder, 4 tbsp Milo powder, and 1 tsp espresso powder until thoroughly combined.
Dump in all of the dry ingredients and mix until no dry spots remain.
Make sure there is enough room in your freezer to freeze a tray of dough balls for 1-2 hours. Line 1 cookie sheet with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Use a medium cookie scoop to gather dough into a 2 ½ tbsp ball.
Split the ball in half. Slightly flatten one half, then add 3-5 mini marshmallows (or ½ regular sized marshmallow) in the middle. Top with other half of cookie dough and seal the sides, making sure the marshmallows are fully enclosed. This step is important so the marshmallows do not melt out of the cookies.
Shape into a ball, then place on lined baking sheet.
If you'd like to make bear-shaped cookies, make ½ tsp balls for each ear, then place on lined baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining cookie dough. Shape the dough into regular cookies, bear cookies, or a mix of both!
*Since you are just freezing them, you can keep the cookies close together. You only need to space them out when you bake them.
Place tray of cookie dough balls in freezer for 1-2 hours, or until dough balls are completely firm. This step will also minimize the marshmallows not completely melt out of the cookies when baking.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats. Add ¼ cup granulated sugar to a small bowl.
Roll each cookie dough ball into granulated sugar and place on lined baking sheet, about 3-4 inches apart. If making bears, roll the ears in sugar and place two ears on top of each cookie ball.
Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until edges are set.
Let cool on pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cool completely.
You can use a piping bag, toothpick, or cookie scribe to add on the details.
Use melted white chocolate to create the snouts and ears. Save remaining white chocolate.
Pipe milk chocolate for the nose and eyes.
Add oil-based red or pink food coloring to the melted white chocolate. If you don't have oil-based food coloring, then the chocolate will seize/become lumpy.
To counter this, stir in a tsp of neutral oil (canola, vegetable) at a time, until it becomes smooth again.

In a large mixing bowl, use silicone spatula to mix the melted ½ cup unsalted butter, ¼ cup granulated sugar, and ⅓ cup light or dark brown sugar until combined. Scrape bottom of bowl.
Add 1 egg and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.
Dump in all of the dry ingredients and mix with silicone spatula until there are only a few dry spots of flour left.
In a medium microwave-safe bowl, add 1 cup frozen blueberries. Microwave for 1:00 minute, stirring halfway through, or until blueberries are thawed, slightly soft, but not too warm.
It's ok if there is a pool of blueberry juice—we will use all of it. The dough should be a little sticky, but easily scoopable.
Add all of the blueberries, including any liquid, into cookie dough. Mix until fully incorporated. Let the dough sit for about 5 minutes before scooping.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177℃ and line two baking trays with parchment paper.
Add ¼ cup granulated sugar to a small bowl or plate. You will use this for rolling the dough balls.
Use a medium cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 2-3 tablespoons each). Roll into sugar then place onto lined baking tray, about 3-4 inches apart.
Tip if dough is sticky: Plop the dough from the cookie scoop straight into the granulated sugar. Work quickly to roll it around to avoid it sticking to your fingers. They do not need to be shaped into perfect balls. 🙂
To make bears (optional): For the ears, take about 1 tsp of dough, split it in 2, and roll them in sugar. Place them on top left and right sides of a cookie dough ball on the baking sheet.

Mix in 1 egg at a time until smooth. Stir in 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Mix again until smooth.
(Adding one egg at a time helps the mixture come together to the right consistency more seamlessly. Otherwise, the mixture may separate and be a gloopy mess.
If you added both at the same time, mix until smooth as much as possible. The cookie dough should still come together once you add the dry ingredients.)
Dump in all of the dry ingredients and use silicone spatula to mix until no dry spots remain.
Use a large cookie scoop or dump all of the snickerdoodle dough onto lined baking pan. Press down the dough into a flat layer using your spatula.

Preheat oven to 325°F/163°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Use a small cookie dough scoop to gather dough (about 1 ½ tablespoon each). Shape into a rounded football shape and place onto lined baking tray. Repeat for about 11 more cookies, making sure you have some left over dough for the feet. Place cookies about 3 inches apart.
For the feet, take about 1 tsp of dough, and split it into two equally sized pieces. Roll into balls and place on bottoms of each Oddish.
For the leaves of each Oddish, take about ½ tbsp of green dough and split it into 3 balls. Roll each ball into short cylinders, then pinch the three pieces together at the bottom, making the tops feather out from the base. See the video in the blog post for reference.
Place the leaves on top of Oddish, repeating this step for the remaining cookies.
Bake for 9-11 minutes. For soft cookies, bake them until the edges are just set and firm. For chewier ones, bake for 1-3 more minutes.
Let cool on pan for about 5-10 minutes, then transfer cookies to wire rack. Let cool completely.
You can a piping bag, toothpick, or cookie scribe to add on the details. I used a piping bag for the eyes and mouth, and a scribe for the blush.
Use melted milk/dark chocolate to draw on the eyes and mouth.
Dye the white chocolate pink or red, and use this for the blush.
If you don't have oil-based food coloring, then the chocolate will seize/become lumpy. To counter this, stir in a tsp of neutral oil (canola, vegetable) at a time, until it becomes smooth again.

In a light-colored pan over medium heat, add ½ cup unsalted butter. Continuously stir with a silicone spatula.
After the butter melts, it will begin to foam. Then, the foaming will subside and brown specks will start to form at the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring. The color change will be fairly quick, so keep an eye on the butter. Remove the pan from heat once you smell a nutty aroma and the butter becomes golden brown.

Mix in 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 egg yolk until smooth.
Dump in all of the dry ingredients. Fold using silicone spatula until no dry spots remains.
Now, you will make a ""parchment stack"". The bottom layer will be a large piece of parchment paper, the cookie dough in the middle, then parchment paper on top. This will make rolling out the dough much easier + mess free.
Lay large piece of parchment paper down on work surface. Plop on all of the cookie dough, then lay another piece of parchment on top of it. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large rectangle, until dough is about ¼-inch thick.
Transfer parchment stack to a baking tray and freeze for about 15 minutes. This will make cutting out shapes easier.
Preheat the oven to 350°F/177°C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
This step will help loosen the cookie dough from the parchment paper layers. So when you cut out dough pieces, the dough doesn't stick to the paper and is easier to transfer to your lined baking tray.
Peel off top parchment paper, then lightly stick it back on. Flip the entire parchment-cookie dough-parchment stack over so you can completely peel off the bottom parchment paper.
Using linzer cookie cutters, cut out your desired shapes.
For each sandwich cookie, cut out one cookie with the center punched out (this will be the top) and leave one cookie whole (this will be the bottom). If you don’t have Linzer cutters, use any cookie cutter and a piping tip to punch out the centers.
Transfer cookies to baking sheets, about 2-3 inches apart. The cookies will not spread much while baking.
Tip: Lightly flour your cookie cutter to minimize any sticking. When transferring cut-out cookies to your lined baking sheet, you can slide an offset spatula underneath the cookie to easily pick it up. If the dough is getting too soft, pop it back in the fridge or even the freezer for a few minutes.
Knead together any dough scraps, roll out, and cut out more cookies.
Tip: The colder the cut-out cookies, the more they'll hold their shape when baking! Feel free to freeze your cut-out shapes for 10 minutes before popping them in the oven.

In a large bowl, add 2 tablespoons meringue powder and ¼ cup water. Mix on medium speed until very frothy, about 2-3 minutes.
While mixing on medium-low, gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar. Once all of the powdered sugar is fully incorporated, add ½ teaspoon vanilla extract and pinch fine sea salt.
Whip on medium high for about 3-4 minutes until thickened and white. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, add a few drops of water at a time. If it is too thin, try whipping the mixture longer or adding in more powdered sugar.
Note: For a royal icing consistency perfect for both lining and flooding, drag your whisk through the icing. It should smooth back into an even surface within 15–20 seconds.
Now it's time to color your icing. Divide icing into bowls. Work with one color at a time, covering the remaining bowls with damp paper towels to prevent the icing from drying out.
**As dyed royal icing dries, the color does deepen a few shades darker. So if you're going for pastels, go a bit lighter than you normally would.
Stir in gel food coloring until combined.
To minimize air bubbles in your decorated cookies, let icing rest in the bowl for about 15 minutes, so any trapped air can rise to the surface. Pop bubbles with a toothpick.
Transfer icing to piping bags and cut a small tip. Pipe on outlines to all of your heart cookies first, then go back in to flood them.
Let cookies dry on a wire rack at room temperature for 8-24 hours. Once the icing is fully dry, write on custom messages using edible food markers. Enjoy!

If you’d like to make a chocolate dough, split the cookie dough into two bowls. In one bowl, knead in 2 tablespoons of sifted cocoa powder until the color is uniform.

Place balls about 2-3 inches apart. They will not spread much while baking.
For the ears, take about ½ tsp of dough and split it into two equally sized balls. Place them on top of the bear heads, making sure the doughs are completely touching. You can even use your finger to smooth out the sides where the dough meet. This ensures the ears don't fall off after baking.
Bake for 11-13 minutes. Cookies should have slightly firm edges and golden brown bottoms.

Continuously stir with a whisk or rubber spatula.
After the butter melts, it will begin to foam. Then, the foaming will stop and brown specks will start to form at the bottom of the pan. The color change will be fairly quick, so keep an eye on the butter. Remove the pan from heat once you smell a nutty aroma and the butter becomes golden brown.
Immediately transfer to a heat-safe bowl. Let cool in fridge until the butter firms back up to a softened stage. This may take about 1-2 hours.
In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (can alternatively use hand mixer, whisk, or fork!), mix the butter and sugar on medium speed until smooth. Scrape bottom of bowl.
Add in the egg and vanilla. Stir until combined.
Sift in all of the flour, ground cinnamon, and salt, mixing until no dry spots remain.
Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This will help the dough firm up and will be easier to roll out later.
Preheat oven to 350°F/177°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Now, you will make a ""parchment stack"". The bottom layer will be a large piece of parchment paper, the cookie dough in the middle, then parchment paper on top. This will make rolling out the dough much easier + mess free.
Lay large piece of parchment paper down on work surface. Plop on all of the cookie dough, then lay another piece of parchment on top of it.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large rectangle, until dough reaches desired thickness. I rolled my dough out to a little under half an inch thick.
This step will help loosen the shortbread from the parchment paper layers. So when you cut out dough pieces, the dough doesn't stick to the paper and is easier to transfer to your lined baking tray.
Peel off top parchment paper, then lightly stick it back on. Flip the entire parchment-shortbread-parchment stack over so you can peel off the bottom parchment paper.
Use bear cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. If dough is getting too soft, pop it back in the fridge or even the freezer for a few minutes.
Knead together any dough scraps, roll out, and cut out more bear cookies.
Transfer cookies to baking sheets, about 2-3 inches apart. The cookies will not spread much while baking.
Mix cinnamon sugar ingredients in small bowl, then lightly sprinkle on top of each cookie.
Bake for 10-12 minutes. Cookies should have slightly firm edges and look set (no wet/underbaked spots in dough).
Let cool on pan for about 5-10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack.
Use a piping bag, spoons, or knife to spread on Nutella or jam on each bottom cookie.
Add a matching cookie on top.

Since one egg white weighed 32g, I used 64g granulated sugar. Adjust the weights according to how much your egg white weighs.
In a small-medium mixing bowl, whip your egg whites on medium-low speed until frothy, about 1-2 minutes.
Turn your mixer to medium speed and gradually add granulated sugar 1 tbsp at a time. Continue whipping until your meringue reaches soft peaks.
Add your extract/flavoring. Continue whipping at medium speed until you reach medium peaks and all the sugar is dissolved. This can take up to 10 minutes!
I checked to see if my meringue was ready by holding the whisk and moving the mixture around, allowing it to ribbon onto itself. If the ribbons held their shape, the meringue was ready. If not, I continued mixing on medium speed.
Preheat your oven to 180°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
Split the meringue into the number of colors you want. For my frogs, I split the batter into four bowls to make green, red, yellow, and black meringues.
Add your desired gel/powder food coloring of choice and use a rubber spatula to gently fold the colors in. Scoop the colored meringues into their own piping bags.
Snip the tip of your piping bags and begin creating your characters. Use a cookie scribe or toothpick to move the meringue into place.
