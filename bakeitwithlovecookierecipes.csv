Bat Sugar Cookies,Angela Latimer,5,4,American,Halloween,NA,10 minutes,6 minutes,NA,16 minutes,36 cookies,16,"Cream together the ¾ cup butter and 1 cup sugar in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Then, add the 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt. Mix until thoroughly combined. 
Stir in the 2½ cups all-purpose flour until it is evenly distributed throughout your sugar cookie dough. *If you plan to roll out your sugar cookies soon, place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour. 
If you don't plan on rolling your cookies out for a while (up to 3 days), wrap the cookie dough in cling wrap to refrigerate and chill.
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C/Gas Mark 5) and line your baking sheet(s) with parchment paper.
Once your dough has chilled, separate small portions of the dough to work with on a floured surface. Roll out the dough until ¼-½ inch thick and cut into bats with your bat cookie cutter.  
Transfer your cookies to your prepared baking sheet and bake for 6-9 minutes.
Remove the cookies from the oven before the bottom edges become golden. Let them sit on on the baking sheet for 5-6 minutes before you transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool off completely.
Add the 4 cups confectioners sugar, 3 tablespoon meringue powder, optional ⅓ cup cocoa powder, to a medium mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk to combine. 
Pour the ½ cup water into the bowl and mix (on low speed if using a mixer) until combined.
Drag a knife through the icing to test the consistency. If the gap in the icing closes quickly (in less than 10 seconds) continue to mix until it thickens.
If it takes more than 20 seconds for the gap to close, it is too thick. Add a small amount of water (a few drops) and mix briefly. Repeat the testing process until it reaches the desired consistency.
Add the 2-4 teaspoon black gel food coloring to the icing and mix it together by hand. If the icing is grey, add more black food coloring and mix until it is dark black in color. *Your icing will get truly black when refrigerated overnight.
Add the icing to a piping bag or Ziploc with the corner cut off. Begin by outlining your bats in black icing before filling in the inside. 
Allow the bat sugar cookies to dry overnight before adding the white eyes, if desired.
Combine ½ cup powdered sugar and ½ tablespoon milk in a mixing bowl and combine thoroughly. If icing is too thick, add small amounts of milk as needed until it reaches desired consistency.
Use a piping bag or Ziploc bag with a very small corner cut off to pipe the tiny eyes onto the face of each bat.

Pistachio Macarons,Angela Latimer,5,1,French,Macarons,NA,30 minutes,15 minutes,NA,45 minutes,26 macarons,29,"Place 226 grams white chocolate and 120 grams heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 1 minute. 
Remove the bowl from the microwave and leave it undisturbed for 5 minutes. 
Add 1 tablespoon pistachios and stir until completely combined. 
Transfer the ganache to the fridge to set for at least 2 hours, or until firm. 
Into the bowl of your food processor, add 200 grams confectioners sugar, 95 grams almond flour, and 15 grams pistachio flour. 
Pulse the mixture a few times until you have a really fine powder. 
Use a sieve to sift the flour mixture into a bowl, using a spoon to break up any large chunks. If you have any larger almond chunks remaining that can't pass through the sieve (no more than a tablespoon), you can toss them out. Set the bowl aside. 
Place your 100 grams egg whites into the bowl of your stand mixer and beat using the whisk attachment at medium speed until foamy. 
Add ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar and beat again at medium speed until soft peaks have formed. 
Very slowly, add 60 grams sugar in small increments, giving the mixer about 5 seconds in between each addition to fully incorporate it. 
Once the sugar has all been added, add ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract and the optional green gel food coloring  and beat until stiff peaks have formed (this could take several minutes). 
After you have reached stiff peaks, use a silicone spatula to transfer ⅓ of your meringue into your flour mixture. 
Use a slow, folding motion to gently incorporate the meringue into the dry ingredients. 
Once fully incorporated, repeat this process two more times with the remaining meringue.
After all of the meringue has been added, continue folding the mixture by making a J shape through the batter, rotating the bowl 90°, and repeating. Continue slowly folding until the batter moves similarly to lava and falls off your spatula in a ribbon just long enough to form a figure 8. 
Prepare your baking sheet(s) with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and place a large tip into a piping bag (like a Wilton #12).
Transfer the macaron batter to the piping bag. Place your tip about ¼-inch above the baking sheet at a 90° angle (in the center of the circle, if using a template) and firmly squeeze until the batter fills the inner circle of the template. Stop squeezing and make a quick C shape to break off the batter. 
Pipe the rest of your macarons and then lift the baking sheet about 5 inches above the counter. Firmly bang it on the counter 8-10 times to bring any air bubbles to the surface.
Use a toothpick to pop any lingering air bubbles. 
Leave the macarons to rest for 30-60 minutes, or until they are no longer tacky when touched. 
Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C/Gas Mark 2).
After the macarons are done resting, bake one sheet at a time for 15-18 minutes, or until they don't move on their feet when nudged slightly. 
Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before moving them. 
Match up your macaron shells so that the ones closest in size make a pair. Then, flip one over. 
If desired, decorate the top shell with a little melted white chocolate and a sprinkle of pistachios.
Once your ganache is firm, transfer it to a piping bag with a large round tip or the corner cut off. 
Onto the bottom shell, piped the pistachio white chocolate ganache. Then, add a sprinkle of more crushed pistachios. 
Place the top shell on top and gently press together to form the completed sandwich. 
For best results, place your macarons into a sealed container in the refrigerator to bloom for 24 hours. Let them come to room temperature before serving.

Champagne Macarons,Angela Latimer,5,1,French,Macarons,NA,30 minutes,15 minutes,30 minutes,15 minutes,20 macarons,29,"Pour ½ cup champagne into a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat. 
Once simmering, reduce the heat to medium and let the champagne simmer for about 10 minutes, or until it has reduced by half. 
Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the champagne to cool completely while you make the macarons. 
In the bowl of your food processor, add the 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar.
Blend with the food processor on low speed until the mixture has become extra-fine. Then, use a fine-mesh sieve to sift the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
In the bowl of your stand mixer, use the whisk attachment to beat 100 grams egg whites at medium speed until foamy. 
Add ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar and keep beating until you have soft peaks. 
Very gradually add 80 grams sugar while continuing to mix. 
Once all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the ½ teaspoon vanilla extract and continue mixing at medium-high speed until you have stiff peaks. 
Scoop ⅓ of the whipped egg mixture into your flour mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in until it is combined.
Repeat this process with the remaining ⅔ of the egg whites, only adding ⅓ at a time, and gently folding in between each addition.
After the last bit of the egg mixture has been added, continue to gently and slowly fold the macaron batter until the batter falls from the spatula in ribbons. *The consistency should be similar to honey or lava. If you let the batter fall from your spatula, it should only take about 10 seconds to sink back into itself.
Once you have reached the perfect consistency, transfer the batter into a piping bag that has been fitted with a round tip (or a storage bag with the corner cut off).
Pipe the macarons onto your parchment paper (or mat) in 1½-inch circles, making sure to space them at least ½-inch apart from each other.
Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter 5 times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then, use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles that you might see.
Sprinkle with gold sugar sprinkles if desired. 
Allow the macarons to rest on the counter at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch and no longer tacky.
While the macarons are resting, go ahead and preheat your oven to 300˚F (140˚C/Gas Mark 2).
Once ready, bake the macarons for 15-18 minutes, or until the macarons don't move if you tap on them slightly.
Remove the macarons from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet completely before removing them. 
In a large mixing bowl, add ½ cup butter. I recommend butter that is between 68-70°F (20-21°C), and not so soft that you can easily indent it with your fingertip. 
Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat it for 1 minute until the butter has become light and fluffy.
Add 1¾ cup confectioners sugar, ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 pinch salt and mix until thoroughly combined. 
Pour in a small amount of your 1-2 tablespoon champagne reduction and mix until combined. Keep adding more of the champagne reduction until you meet your desired consistency. 
Beat at medium-high speed for another minute.
Scoop the buttercream into a piping bag with a round tip (or a storage bag with the corner cut off).
Take one cooled macaron shell and pipe some buttercream into the center. Place a second macaron shell on top and gently press them together, forming a sandwich.
Repeat this process with your remaining macaron shells and champagne buttercream.

Next, mix in the egg, vanilla, baking soda, and salt until smooth. Then, slowly incorporate the flour and sifted cocoa powder until you have soft cookie dough.
Scoop out some cookie dough and roll it in between your hands, forming a smooth ball. Place the ball onto your prepared baking sheet and use the bottom of a cup to gently press them down. Once pressed, you want your cookies to be about 3-inches across. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough.
Place the cookies on the center oven rack and bake them at 350°F (175°C) for 7-9 minutes, or until they are no longer shiny and have puffed up.

Prepare a piping bag with a round tip (such as a Wilton #12) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Leave the piping bag in a cup with the tops wrapped around the edges of the cup. Set aside.
In the bowl of your food processor, add 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar.
Blend with the food processor on low speed until the mixture has become extra-fine. Then, use a fine-mesh sieve to sift the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
In a separate large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment to beat 100 grams egg whites until foamy.
Add ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar and keep mixing until soft peaks form.
Gradually add 80 grams sugar while continuing to mix, until everything is fully distributed.
Add ½ teaspoon vanilla extract and continue to mix until stiff peaks form.
Scoop ⅓ of the whipped egg mixture into your flour mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in until it is combined.
Repeat this process with the remaining ⅔ of the egg whites, only adding ⅓ at a time, and gently folding in between each addition.
After the last bit of the egg mixture has been added, continue to gently and slowly fold the macaron batter until the batter falls from the spatula in ribbons. *The consistency should be similar to honey or lava. If you let the batter fall from your spatula, it should only take about 10 seconds to sink back into itself.
Dip a small brush into your red gel food coloring (if desired) and use it to paint the inside of the piping bag in 4 vertical streaks. Make sure the lines go all the way from the bottom with the piping tip to the top.
Transfer the batter into the painted piping bag.
Pipe the macarons onto your parchment paper (or mat) in 1½-inch circles, making sure to space them at least ½-inch apart from each other.
Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter 5 times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then, use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles that you might see.

Being to stir very frequently (about every 30 seconds). As the sugar heats up, it will begin to clump up before smoothing out and melting.
As soon as the sugar has melted completely, immediately remove it from the heat and add 6 tablespoon butter, and continue stirring constantly. It will bubble a ton, which is normal. 
Continue stirring as you pour in the ⅓ cup heavy cream and ½ teaspoon flaky sea salt.
Once everything is combined, pour the salted caramel into a glass jar and let it cool completely before using it.
In the bowl of your food processor, add the 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar.
Pulse the food processor several times to form a fine mixture. Then, sift the mixture into a large bowl and set it aside. 
Using your stand mixer with the whisk attachment, 100 grams egg whites, and ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
Very gradually add 80 grams sugar to the egg whites while continuing to mix, until everything is fully distributed.
Continue to beat the egg mixture until stiff peaks form.
Scoop ⅓ of the whipped egg mixture into your flour mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in until it is combined.
Repeat this process with the remaining ⅔ of the egg whites, only adding ⅓ at a time, and gently folding in between each addition.
After the last bit of the egg mixture has been added, continue to gently and slowly fold the macaron batter until the batter falls from the spatula in ribbons that only last long enough to form a figure 8 without breaking. *The consistency should be similar to honey or lava. If you let the batter fall from your spatula, it should only take about 10 seconds to sink back into itself.
Transfer the macaron batter to a piping bag with a round tip or a storage bag with the tip cut off. Prepare your baking sheets with some parchment paper or silicone baking mats. 
Pipe the macarons onto your parchment paper (or mat) in 1½-inch circles, making sure to space them at least ½-inch apart from each other.
Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter 5 times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then, use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles that you might see.
Allow the macarons to rest on the counter at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch and no longer tacky.
While the macarons are resting, go ahead and preheat your oven to 300˚F (150˚C/Gas Mark 2).
Once ready, bake the macarons for 13-17 minutes, or until the macarons don't move on their feet if you give them a gentle nudge.
Remove the macarons from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
In a large mixing bowl, add ½ cup butter. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat it for 1 minute until the butter has become light and fluffy.
Add 1½ cups confectioners sugar and mix until combined.
Finally, add ¼ cup salted caramel and mix again until the buttercream is well combined and smooth.
If you like, you can add a drizzle of your salted caramel onto half of your macaron shells (for the tops) as well as a sprinkle of flaky sea salt.
Scoop the buttercream and salted caramel into separate piping bags with a round tip (or storage bags with the corners cut off). 
Take a bottom macaron shell (one without a caramel drizzle) and pipe a ring of salted caramel buttercream around the outer edge. Then, squeeze a small amount of salted caramel into the center of the ring.
Repeat this process with your remaining macaron shells. 
For best results, place the macarons into an airtight container in the fridge for 24 hours.

Sift the mixture into a large mixing bowl and set it aside. 
Add 100 grams egg whites to the bowl of your stand mixer and use the whisk attachment to beat the egg whites at medium speed until frothy. 
Add ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar and mix until you reach soft peaks. 
Very slowly mix in 60 grams sugar in small increments until completely combined. 
Pour in ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract and add a few drops of orange gel food coloring and then continue to mix at medium-high speed until you reach very stiff peaks. 
Scoop ⅓ of your meringue into the bowl with your flour mixture and use a silicone spatula to gently fold the mixture together until combined. 
Repeat this process two more times with the remaining ⅔ of your meringue. 
Once all of the meringue has been combined with the flour, keep slowly folding the batter until it reaches a consistency that moves similarly to lava and falls off the spatula in ribbons. Don't rush this process, as you don't want to risk overmixing the batter.  
Transfer the batter to your prepared piping bag. Holding it at a 90° angle above your baking sheet, squeeze the bag to pipe the macarons. Once the batter fills the inner circle of your template (if you're using one), stop squeezing and flick the tip in a C shape to break the batter and continue piping the remaining shells. 
Once you have piped all of the macarons, raise the baking sheet about 8 inches off of the counter and drop it 5 times to bring any air bubbles to the surface. Use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles. 
Leave the macarons to rest for 30-60 minutes, or until they form a skin and are no longer tacky to the touch.
Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C/Gas Mark 2). 
Once the shells are done resting, bake them in the oven for 15-18 minutes, or until they have puffed up, and don't move on their feet if you nudge them.

Get a piping bag ready with a large round tip or a storage bag with the corner cut off. 
Add 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar to the bowl of your food processor and pulse it a few times until well combined. 
Sift the mixture into a bowl and set aside. 
Add 100 grams egg whites to the bowl of your stand mixer.
Using the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites at medium speed until foamy, then add ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar.
Continue to beat until soft peaks have formed (usually when you can see the lines left by the whisk). 
Very slowly add 80 grams sugar while continuing to mix on medium speed. You don't want to add the sugar too quickly, or it could cause the meringue to deflate. 
After all of the sugar has been added, add your ½ teaspoon vanilla extract and green gel food coloring. 
Continue beating on medium to medium-high speed until you have reached stiff peaks. When you life the whisk out of the meringue, it should stick straight up and not droop down at all. 
Transfer ⅓ of your meringue to the bowl with your dry ingredients. Using a silicone spatula, gently begin folding the ingredients together. 
Once combined, repeat this process with the second and then final portion of the meringue.
After all of the meringue has been added to the bowl, continue folding by making a J shape with the spatula, turning the bowl 90°, and repeating the process. As you fold, the mixture will become thinner and more runny. You know you are done folding when it moves similarly to lava and falls off the spatula in a ribbon just long enough to form a figure 8. 
Transfer the batter to your prepared piping bag. Holding the bag about ¼-inch above the baking sheet at a 90° angle, squeeze the batter until it fills the inner circle of your template (or reaches your desired size), then stop squeezing and make a quick C shape to break the batter. Repeat with the remaining batter.  
Once the macarons are piped, lift the baking sheet about 5 inches above the counter and drop it 5-8 times to bring any air bubbles to the surface. 
Use a toothpick to pop any remaining air bubbles. 
Leave the macarons to rest on the counter for 30-60 minutes, or until they form a skin and are no longer tacky to the touch. 
Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C/Gas Mark 2). 
Bake the macarons for 15-18 minutes, or until they no longer slide on their feet if you nudge them gently. 
Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing them. 
In the bowl of your stand mixer, cream together ¼ cup butter and 4 oz cream cheese until smooth and creamy.
Add ½ cup confectioners sugar and mix, slowly at first, until well combined. 
Add 1 tablespoon key lime juice, 2 teaspoon key lime zest, and ¼ teaspoon salt and beat again at medium speed until fluffy and fully mixed. Taste and adjust the salt if needed.

In the bowl of your food processor, add the 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar.
Blend with the food processor on low speed until the mixture has become very fine. Then, use a fine-mesh sieve to sift the mixture into a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to push any large chunks through the sieve. Set aside.
In a separate large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment to beat the 100 grams egg whites and ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar until soft peaks form. The egg mixture will start out foamy and will have soft peaks once the whisk begins to leave tracks.
Gradually add 80 grams sugar to the egg whites while continuing to mix, until everything is fully distributed.
Continue to beat the egg mixture until stiff peaks form.
Scoop ⅓ of the whipped egg mixture into your flour mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in until it is combined.
Repeat this process with the remaining ⅔ of the egg whites, only adding ⅓ at a time, and gently folding in between each addition.
After the last bit of the egg mixture has been added, continue to gently and slowly fold the macaron batter until the batter falls from the spatula in ribbons. *The consistency should be similar to honey or lava. If you let the batter fall from your spatula, it should only take about 10 seconds to sink back into itself.
Once you have reached the perfect consistency, transfer the batter into a piping bag that has been fitted with a round tip (or a storage bag with the corner cut off).
If you have a macaron mat, place it onto your rimmed baking sheet. However, if you don't have one, place a dot of batter into each corner of your rimmed baking sheet and place a piece of parchment paper on top (the batter acts as glue to keep the paper from sliding around).
Pipe the macarons onto your parchment paper (or mat) in 1½-inch circles, making sure to space them at least ½-inch apart from each other.
Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter 5 times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then, use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles that you might see.
Use a small sieve to sift the crushed raspberries over the top of the shells. 
Allow the macarons to rest on the counter at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch and no longer tacky.
While the macarons are resting, go ahead and preheat your oven to 300˚F (150˚C/Gas Mark 2) and move the rack to the lowest part of your oven.
Once ready, bake the macarons for 13-17 minutes, or until the macarons don't move if you tap on them slightly. If your raspberry powder is browning too quickly, you can cover the macarons lightly with foil and finish baking. 
Remove the macarons from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
In a large mixing bowl, add your ¼ cup butter, 1½ cup confectioners sugar, and ⅓ cup freeze-dried raspberry powder.
Mix, starting on low speed and gradually increasing it, until thick and creamy.
Add 2 tablespoon heavy cream to thin out the buttercream as needed and whip until you reach your desired consistency. Taste and adjust with the optional 1 pinch salt to reduce the sweetness.
Scoop the buttercream into a piping bag with a round tip (or a storage bag with the corner cut off).
Take one cooled macaron shell and pipe some buttercream into the center. Place a second macaron shell on top and gently press them together, forming a sandwich.

In the bowl of your stand mixer, add 100 grams egg whites and ⅛ teaspoon cream of tartar. Beat on medium-high speed using the whisk attachment until soft peaks form (typically when you can see the tracks from the whisk). 
Gradually add 90 grams sugar while continuing to mix.
Keep beating the egg whites until they reach stiff peaks, being careful not to over or undermix them.

Once combined, add the second ⅓, fold again, and then add the final ⅓ portion of the meringue. 
Once all of the meringue has been added, continue to slowly fold the mixture by making a J shape, turning the bowl 90°, and repeating the process. Fold until the batter falls off the spatula in ribbons and takes about 10 seconds to sink back into itself. 
Add your batter to a piping bag with a Wilton #12 tip or a storage bag with the tip cut off and line your baking sheet with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.  
Hold the piping bag at a 90° angle above your baking sheet (in the center of the circle, if using a template) and firmly squeeze without moving the bag until the batter fills the inner circle of the template. Then, stop squeezing and make a quick C shape to break off the batter. If not using a template, simply make uniform-sized circles. Repeat with all of the remaining batter. 
Lift the baking sheet about 8 inches above the counter and drop it 5-8 times to remove any air bubbles. Then, take a toothpick and pop any that you can still see (it is slightly more difficult to spot the bubbles due to the speckled nature of these shells). 
Leave the macaron shells to rest for 30-60 minutes, or until they are no longer tacky to the touch and lose their glossy sheen. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C/Gas Mark 2).

Microwave the lemon curd mixture in 30-second increments, stirring well with a spoon in between each one. This will take several minutes. You'll know it is ready when you can see the stirring tracks in the curd and it sticks to the back of your spoon.
Set the lemon curd in the fridge to chill while you prepare the macarons.
Add 125 grams almond flour and 125 grams confectioners sugar to your food processor and blend until the mixture is extra fine.
Use a sieve to sift the almond flour mixture into a large mixing bowl, using a spoon to break up any chunks. There may be some larger almond pieces left over at the end, but try to discard as little as possible.
In a metal or glass bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment to beat 100 grams egg whites¼ teaspoon cream of tartar, and the optional ½ teaspoon lemon extract on medium speed. The eggs will be foamy and then will reach soft peaks.
Once you have soft peaks, slowly mix in the 80 grams sugar on medium speed until well combined.
Continue to beat the meringue at medium-high speed until medium peaks have formed. Then, you can add the optional yellow gel food coloring and continue to beat until you have stiff peaks. 
Slowly fold ⅓ of the meringue into your flour mixture until combined.

After the meringue has been thoroughly added, continue to gently and slowly fold the macaron batter until the batter falls from the spatula in ribbons. *The consistency should be similar to honey or lava. If you let the batter fall from your spatula, it should only take about 10 seconds to sink back into itself.
Once you have reached the perfect consistency, transfer the batter into a piping bag that has been fitted with a round tip (or a storage bag with the corner cut off).
Place parchment paper or a macaron mat onto your baking sheet.
Pipe the macarons onto your parchment paper (or mat) in 1½-inch circles, making sure to space them at least ½-inch apart from each other.
Firmly tap the baking sheet on the counter 5 times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then, use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles that you might see.
Allow the macarons to rest on the counter at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch and no longer tacky. Don't let them continue to rest past this point.

Once the butter and sugar are combined, add the extracts and egg, baking powder and pinch of salt. Combine thoroughly.
Add the flour, starting with 2 cups. Work the flour into the dough, even with only ⅔ of the flour mixed in the dough may seem crumbly but it will all come together when turned out and kneaded (like bread) before rolling out to cut shapes.
Once the first 2 cups of flour has been incorporated, turn the dough out onto a well floured surface or pastry mat and work the remaining flour into the dough until you have a firm cookie dough for rolling. *Typically, I use 2 ¾ cups of the flour at this point and save the remaining ¼ cup of flour for working with the dough while rolling.

Line your baking sheets with parchment paper and move your oven racks to the bottom racks in your oven.
Separate your egg whites from your room temperature eggs (if they are not room temp, place your eggs in a glass or bowl of warm tap water for about 5-10 minutes). Be sure when you separate the egg whites that the whites go into a clean, dry bowl. Any water or residue will affect how well your egg whites stiffen into soft peaks.
Place your egg whites into the bowl of your stand mixer, add salt and cream of tartar and use the whisk attachment at medium speed until soft peaks are formed (about 1-2 minutes).
Add the sugar to the egg whites slowly incorporating it into the meringue (you can process your sugar in a food processor by pulsing a few times to make superfine sugar so that all of the sugar melts easily). Once all of the sugar is added and well combined, test the consistency by rubbing between your fingertips to ensure that all of the sugar has melted.
Add eggnog and vanilla paste (or extract) and freshly grated nutmeg. Continue to mix on high speed until stiff peaks are formed, and your meringue is smooth and glossy.
Use a piping bag with a large star piping tip, or a Ziploc baggie (with the corner cut off) and pipe the meringue onto your parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Leave about ½"" between each 1-1 ½"" sized meringue star.
Place baking sheets into the oven on the lower racks, and bake at 200°F (90°C) for 1 hour 15 minutes. If you need to use a higher baking temperature, reduce the baking time until the outside of the meringues are dry but not changing color, or browning at the bottoms.
When the meringues are dry to the touch, turn off your oven and allow them to cool completely in the oven and preferably overnight.

Reserve 1 cup of the crust/topping crumbles to use as the topping later. Transfer the rest of the crust mixture to your 9x13 pan and cover the bottom of the pan completely, pressing the crust mixture down to make an even base layer.
Bake the crust for 15 minutes in your preheated oven. While the crust is baking, start mixing the pineapple filling. 
In a large bowl or your stand mixer bowl, combine beaten eggs, sugar, sour cream, salt, flour, and pineapple. Stir gently to combine.
After the crust has baked for 15 minutes, allow to cool for a few minutes then spoon the filling over the crust layer. Crumble the reserved 1 cup of the crust mixture over the filling layer and bake for 1 hour or until golden (lightly).
Allow baked pineapple bars to cool for 15 minutes on a cooling rack. 
While cooling, mix up the coconut icing: in a small bowl, combine confectioners sugar, half-and-half, and coconut extract. 
Stir until the icing is smooth and thick enough to slowly drizzle over the pineapple bars (add more confectioners sugar if needed, to thicken - conversely, add more half-and-half if the icing is too thick).
Drizzle the icing over your pan of cooled pineapple bars, cut into squares and serve.",13,▢ 1½ cups all-purpose flour,▢ ½ cup sugar,▢ 1 pinch salt,"▢ ¾ cup butter (cold, cubed butter)",▢ 2 large eggs (beaten),▢ 1 cup sugar,▢ ½ cup sour cream,▢ 1 pinch salt,▢ ½ cup all-purpose flour,"▢ ½ whole pineapple (fresh, finely sliced or 1 16 ounce can of crushed pineapple, drained)",▢ 1 cup confectioners sugar,▢ 2 tablespoon half-and-half (use more as needed),▢ 1 teaspoon coconut extract,NA,NA,Bake It With Love,https://bakeitwithlove.com/pineapple-bars-recipe/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
