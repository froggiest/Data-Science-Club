To make the royal icing, beat the powdered sugar, flavor extract, water, and meringue powder in a stand mixer or in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer until it’s fluffy and has stiff peaks, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Check the consistency of your icing. If it's too thick add more water a little at a time. For these cookies, the icing should be a medium consistency. It should take about 15 seconds to disappear. This should work for flooding and details and should not be runny so it doesn't run through the icing dam. Medium royal icing is slightly thinner than piping icing.
Once you have the consistency you want, place it into a piping bag or a plastic baggie. If you are using a piping bag, seal it with a knot or with a rubber band.
Cut a tiny edge of the bottom of the bag to use.
Outline each cookie with the icing and continue making a spiral inwards.
