Sand Dollar Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Published: Dec 10, 2025",5,1,Cookies,40 minutes,12 minutes,Chill Time: 1 hour hour,NA,Servings: 30,12,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer) add the butter, sugar, and be on high speed to cream them until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the egg, almond extract, and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour (and 1/2 tsp salt if you're using unsalted butter) and beat on low speed until just incorporated and a smooth dough forms.
Pat the dough into a large ball, wrap it with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350F and line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Lightly flour your clean countertop, place the chilled dough on it, and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. I make two rounds of dough because I think it's easier to work with, but you can make one. Tips – If the dough seems too sticky, put a little more flour on the rolling pin or lightly sprinkle it on the dough itself. Or place it back in the fridge for a 5-10 minutes and that'll help it firm up and you can try again to roll it out.
After the dough has been rolled out, cut the dough into round discs using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter. Place the discs onto a parchment lined baking sheet, adding no more than 12 per baking sheet. You can re-roll the dough scraps and cut them out.
Place 5 almond slices gently into the center of each disc, arranged like flower petals, to create a sand dollar appearance.
Squeeze a plastic straw into an oval shape or use an exacto knife to create the small holes on each piece. Then use a toothpick to remove the dough from the straw. Discard these little pieces of dough. Tip – You don't have to make as many holes as I made in my cookies because it is a bit time-consuming and they don't have to look perfect, just do your best.
Bake the cookies for approximately 10-12 minutes (start checking earlier than that) or until the edges are lightly golden brown.
Baking Tips – Keep a very close eye on the cookies because they're very thin and they'll bake quite quickly. Although all ovens very, so you should bake until the cookies are done in your oven, whatever that means on the clock. In some ovens, the baking time may be more than I suggest. If possible, I recommend baking one sheet of cookies at a time, using the center oven rack, and rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking to ensure the most optimal browning. I always find that if I bake two sheets of cookies at once, that the cookie sheet underneath never bakes quite as nicely as the one above that's on the center rack but do as you wish.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet until they're cool enough to transfer to wire racks to cool fully.
Optionally before serving, you may dust the cookies with a bit of powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar, depending on your preference.",6,"▢ 12 tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature (I use salted butter but unsalted may be used and also add 1/2 teaspoon salt when you add the flour)",▢ ½ cup granulated sugar,"▢ 1 large egg, room temperature","▢ 1 ½ teaspoons almond extract, or to taste (vanilla extract may be substituted or added in addition to the almond extract)",▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,"▢ Sliced almonds, as needed",Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/sand-dollar-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pistachio Pudding Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Published: Dec 05, 2025",5,2,Cookies,10 minutes,10 minutes,NA,NA,Servings: 24,9,"Preheat oven to 350 and line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper and spray, or spray them directly with cooking spray; set aside.
To a large mixing bowl, add the butter, sugars, and beat on high speed to cream the ingredients, about 3-4 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Stop to scrap down the sides of the bowl.
Add the egg, vanilla, and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Stop to scrap down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, pudding mix (the whole packet of dry pudding mix, just add it in like flour), baking soda, salt, and slowly beat to incorporate. Stop to scrap down the sides of the bowl. Tip – If you want your cookies to be greener (for Christmas or St. Patrick's Day for example), now is the time to add a few drops of green food coloring, beat to incorporate, and add more if desired until you reach the desired intensity of green shade.
Add the white chocolate chips, 3/4 cup pistachios, and beat on low to incorporate. As desired, add additional pistachios. Tip – It'll depend on how small the bits of nuts are and your general preference for them.
Using a medium cookie scoop, which is about 2 tablespoons, form evenly sized cookie dough balls, flatten between your palms slightly, and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spaced about 2 inches apart.
Tips – If the dough is very sticky to work with, pop the bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes before forming balls, but it likely won't be necessary.
I recommend making the cookies the size that I indicate so they cook in the indicated amount of time. I wouldn't make them much smaller nor bigger, it's a recipe that I recommend sticking with approximately 2 tablespoons of dough. If necessary in order so the baking sheet is not crowded, you may need to use three baking sheets.
Bake the cookies for approximately 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are just barely turning brown. Baking Tips – Because these cookies are a pale green, you'll really notice the browning on the undersides and edges, so definitely keep a watchful eye so they don't get too dark (this is why bigger cookies are not better for this recipe). Based on how your oven runs, your climate, the thickness of your baking sheets, and the exact size of your cookie dough balls, the baking time will vary. 8 to 10 minutes is my estimate but they may take less time or more time, you'll need to be the judge of that.
Baking Tips Continued – If possible, I recommend baking one sheet of cookies at a time, on the middle rack, and rotating the pan midway through baking for the most evenly baked cookies. Cookies baked on the rack underneath (if you're baking two sheets at a time) never get quite the same texture or color as the cookies baked on the middle rack by themselves.

Stuffed Cherry Pie Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Published: Feb 05, 2025",5,1,Cookies,15 minutes,12 minutes,Chill Time: 30 minutes minutes,NA,Servings: 12,13,"Cookies – To the bowl of a stand mixer (or large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, sugars, and beat on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the eggs, vanilla, and beat to incorporate and until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
With the mixing running on low, slowly add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and beat to just incorporate – don't overmix. Dough Tips – Dough should be smooth enough to work with and form into balls and not overly sticky. If for some reason it's sticky, add 1-3 tablespoons flour, 1 tbsp at a time. I don't foresee this to be necessary but if you need this option, now you know what to do.
Divide the dough into 12 equal sized mounds, roll into balls between your palms, and flatted each about halfway into discs.
Place the discs on a clean countertop or work surface, and add a dollop (about 1 heaping tablespoon) of cherry preserves or jam to the center of each, and fold the edges into the center to completely enclose the preserves or jam. Tip – It's very important to seal well because you don't want the jam to leak out while baking because not only will it make a mess, it'll be prone to burning.
Chilling – Place the 12 stuffed dough balls into the fridge and chill for 30 minutes. Do not skip this step or try to game the system and do it in the freezer because they can actually get overly cold.
While the dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 350F, and line 1 or 2 baking sheets with Silpat baking mats or parchment paper; set aside.
After the dough has chilled, place the mounds of dough on the baking sheet(s), evenly spaced. Spacing Tips – These are pretty big cookies and I wouldn't be surprised if you can only fit 6-8 per baking sheet, even if you're using half sheet pans. It's better to use 2 sheets than crowd onto 1.
Baking – Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes, or until the edges are set and the tops are mostly set even if a little glossy. Baking Tips – I tend to pull cookies when they're a bit underdone looking on top because they do firm up as they cool. However, everyone's preferences are different so bake as long as you like and for as long as is necessary in your oven since all ovens, climates, baking sheets, etc. vary. I always rotate my baking sheets once midway through baking. And I prefer to bake 1 sheet of cookies at a time because the sheet on the bottom never turns out as nice as the sheet on top, but it's up to you.
Cooling – Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes. Make sure they're sufficiently cooled if you're glazing them or it'll just melt and turn into a mess.
Glaze (optional but recommended) – To a medium bowl, add all the ingredients (except sprinkles), whisk to combine, and if necessary add a bit more sugar/milk to thicken or thin out the glaze, as desired.
Using a small spoon, drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies.
If desired, add sprinkles to the top of each cookie before the glaze sets. Wait about 15 minutes, or until the glaze has set fully before enjoying (or sooner if you don't care about a bit of messiness).",14,"▢ ¾ cup butter, softened (I use unsalted but if using salted omit the added salt)","▢ ¾ cup light brown sugar, packed",▢ ¾ cup white granulated sugar,▢ 2 large eggs,"▢ 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, (or sub 1 teaspoon vanilla extract + 1 teaspoon almond extract)",▢ 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/stuffed-cherry-pie-cookies/,▢ ½ teaspoon baking soda,▢ ½ teaspoon baking powder,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,"▢ 1 cup cherry preserves, divided, (or cherry jam, NOT cherry pie filling and not cherry jelly","▢ 2 ½ cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted if lumpy","▢ 2-3 tablespoons whole milk, (2% may be substituted)","▢ ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract, (or sub with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract)","▢ Valentine’s Sprinkles, optional and as desired",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Lemon Cool Whip Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Published: Dec 13, 2024",5,2,Cookies,10 minutes,10 minutes,NA,Total Time: 20 minutes minutes,Servings: 20,6,"Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
To a large bowl, add the cake mix, Cool Whip, egg, and use a spatula to fold to combine and incorporate the ingredients. Tips – Folding will take about 3 minutes. Don't be surprised that it can take a while to make sure all the cake mix is dissolved. However, don't use an electric mixer or it will deflate the Cool Whip.
Optionally, place the bowl in the fridge to chill for 30-60 minutes which will help reduce the stickiness of the dough. It's not mandatory but will make scooping the dough in the next step a bit easier.
Add the confectioners' sugar to a medium bowl and using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop, create cookie dough balls. Drop the cookie dough balls directly into the confectioners' sugar – don't attempt to roll them in your hands because the dough is very sticky.
Place the sugar-coated dough balls on the baking sheets, evenly spaced, and baked for about 8 to 10 minutes, or as desired. Baking Tips – Always watch your cookies, and not the clock when determining doneness. Light colored cookies will show the visible signs (burnt look) of overbaking so take care not to overbake. Conversely, don't underbake. However, if in doubt, I err on the side of underbaking since cookies will continue to firm up as they cool on the baking sheets. I prefer to bake one sheet of cookies at a time, rotating it midway through baking to ensure even baking. If you do bake two sheets of cookies at once, especially with light colored cookies like these, you need to rotate your baking sheets, top and bottom, and front to back, so they all bake uniformly.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes and removing and placing on a rack to cool fully. Tip – To make perfectly shaped cookies, use a glass and swirl it around each cookie when it’s still hot from the oven.",4,"▢ 15.25 ounces boxed lemon cake mix , (see FAQs for questions)","▢ 8 ounces Cool Whip whipped topping, (thawed; full fat or Lite recommended)",▢ 1 large egg,"▢ ½ cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed",NA,NA,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/lemon-cool-whip-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
The Best Oatmeal M&M Chocolate Chip Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Jul 15, 2025",4.47,80,Cookies,10 minutes,12 minutes,NA,Total Time: 22 minutes minutes,Servings: 12,7,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) add the egg, butter, sugars, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add 1 cup M&Ms, chocolate chips, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 15 to 30 seconds.
Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 12 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tips – You can use a smaller scoop if you want to yield more cookies. Remember to reduce the baking time depending on how much smaller you make them. Strategically place a few extra M&Ms on top of each mound of dough for visual appeal.
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat liner or spray with cooking spray.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the chocolate chunks, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form approximately 14 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip – Strategically place a few chocolate chunks on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top.
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet). Evenly sprinkle the top of each dough mound with flaky sea salt, to taste. I use generous pinches.
Bake for about 10 to 13 minutes (less time for super soft cookies, longer for more well-done cookies), or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. All ovens, cookie sizes, and climates vary, and baking times listed are only guidelines. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don’t use a rack.
Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Lemon Crinkle Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 11, 2026",5,5,Cookies,15 minutes,13 minutes,NA,Total Time: 28 minutes minutes,24 cookies,13,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, sugars, egg, lemon extract* (See Notes), and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the lemon zest (tip – make sure to only use the bright yellow part and not the white pith which is bitter), honey, optional yellow food color ** (see Notes) start with 1/2 teaspoon), and beat on medium speed momentarily to incorporate. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda; do not mix yet. Tip – Keep the baking soda in a little mound on top of the other dry ingredients.
Squeeze the lemon juice directly over the baking soda mound. It will bubble and foam, which means the baking soda is good and active, which translates to better tasting and better-textured cookies. Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute; do not overmix.
Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Tips – Do not bake with unchilled dough, as it will spread when baking. However, don't forget about the bowl and chill it for more than 2 hours because the dough will get too firm and will be difficult, crumbly, and necessarily challenging to scoop out.
Preheat the oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners; set aside.
Using a small cookie scoop, form approximately 24 equally-sized mounds of dough balls.
To a small/medium bowl add the granulated sugar and in a separate small/medium bowl add the confectioners' sugar.
Roll each dough ball first in granulated sugar, then in confectioners' sugar, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all dough balls have been rolled. Tip – If you want a heavier looking appearance (or taste) of powdered sugar, roll each dough ball a second or even a third time through the confectioners' sugar. It has a way of almost disappearing into the cold/moist dough so I always roll 2-3x. You will need to use more sugar if you decide to do roll them extra times.
Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes, or until the edges are set and the centers are just set and done. Baking Tips – I always bake one sheet of cookies at a time on the center rack of my oven, rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking to ensure the most even baking results. I find that baking two sheets at once results in the sheet underneath not baking quite as nicely although your results may vary.
Baking time will vary depending on your oven, climate, the exact size of your dough balls, and so forth. Bake until done, whatever that means, for you. Watch your cookies not the clock.
If for some reason your cookies aren't spreading (could be you over-floured the dough, or it was exceptionally cold going into the oven), but about halfway through the baking time, remove the baking sheet from the oven and give is a light 'slam' on your counter or burners, or allow it to fall about 2 inches. This whack will help encourage the cookies to spread a bit if they aren't already so that the crinkle appearance can develop.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 5 days.
You can freeze baked cookies but the appearance of the powdered sugar look will greatly minimize during the freezing/thawing process. I find it better to freeze unbaked dough balls airtight for up to 3 months, and before baking the dough, roll them through the two sugars. You don't need to thaw the dough balls fully and they can be semi-frozen going into the oven, noting you may need to add a couple minutes to the overall baking time.",15,"▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",▢ ¾ cup granulated sugar,"▢ 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed",▢ 1 large egg,▢ 1 tablespoon lemon extract*,▢ 2 tablespoons lemon zest,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/lemon-crinkle-cookies/,▢ 1 tablespoon honey,"▢ ½ teaspoon yellow food color**, optional but recommended and as desired",▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,▢ 2 teaspoons cornstarch,▢ 1 teaspoon baking soda,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ 2 tablespoons lemon juice,▢ ¼ cup granulated sugar,▢ 1 cup confectioners’ sugar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, and beat on high speed for 1 minute, or until soft and creamy; stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the sugars and beat for 1 minute, or until light and creamy.
Add the egg, milk, vanilla, and beat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until creamy and combined; stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Slowly add the dry ingredients, little by little, beating to incorporate them as you go, until you've added everything and a smooth dough forms; don't overmix.
Add the food color (I use
liquid food color, but
gel food colormay be used noting you'll need less because it's more concentrated) and beat carefully to incorporate, taking care that it doesn't splatter up on you because it stains everything in its presence.
Food Coloring Tips
– I used 4 teaspoons liquid food color but you can use up to about 5-6 teaspoons if you want a brighter and/or more prominent red color. If you want fire engine red cookies, you'll either need to use at least 2-3 tablespoons (not teaspoons) liquid food color, or perhaps about 3/4 to 1 tablespoon gel food color.
Add the white chocolate chips and mix to incorporate.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill for 1 hour. Tips – Alternatively, you can form dough balls and place them on a plate to chill for up to 48 hours. However, if you're going to keep the dough chilling in the bowl, after 1 hour, retrieve it and form the cookie dough balls, otherwise the dough simply gets too hard to chisel out of the bowl.
Preheat the oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment or Silpat baking mats; set aside momentarily.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form approximately 20 mounds of dough, about 2 tablespoons each in size and evenly place them on the baking sheets. You'll want about 10 to 12 dough balls per baking sheet, but not more, because they'll spread and need room.
Bake for about 12 to 13 minutes, or just until the edges are beginning to set, even if the centers look undone because the cookies will firm up as they cool. Allow them to sit on the bakings sheets and firm. up for about 10 minutes, or until they're cool enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (See More Baking Tips below). Tip – If desired, add a couple white chocolate chips to the top of each freshly baked cookie for visual appeal and a burst of additional chocolate flavor.
Storage – Cookies are best fresh but will keep airtight at room temp for up to 5 days. Unbaked cookie dough balls can remain airtight in the fridge for up to 48-72 hours before being baked. Unbaked cookie dough balls will keep airtight in the freezer for up to 3-4 months. You do not need to thaw them and can bake straight from frozen, simply add 1-2 minutes or as necessary to the baking time so they're done. You can also freeze baked cookies airtight for up to 3-4 months, although I prefer freezing the cookie dough balls so that I can always bake up a batch of fresh cookies.

Using a medium cookie scoop, make the cookie dough balls using about 2-3 tablespoons of dough per cookie dough ball, which makes approximately 20 to 24 equal-sized mounds of dough. Roll between your palms to form smooth balls, and flatten slightly.
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 3 days. Tip – Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.
Baking – When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350F.
Line two baking sheets with Silpat Baking Mats (or parchment paper; or spray the baking sheets with cooking spray) and place about 8 to 10 cookie dough balls per sheet, evenly spaced; do not crowd.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked and glossy in the center. Don’t overbake which is easy to do with dark cookies. Cookies firm up as they cool. Tips – Bake the cookies until they're done and the baking time could range from 8 to 13 minutes or so, depending on how big or small the dough balls are, your oven, your climate, your baking sheet material, etc. Watch your cookies and not the clock when determining doneness.
Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet while you make the German Chocolate Frosting.
German Chocolate Frosting – As a timesaving tip, feel free to use one or two tubs of store bought Chocolate Pecan Frosting. Frost the cooled cookies as desired.
However, if you're making the frosting from scratch, to a small saucepan add the evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter, and heat over medium heat. Tip – Make sure not to confuse evaporated milk with sweetened condensed milk; select the former not the later. Regular milk should not be substituted.
Once it begins to boil, boil it a medium boil for approximately 10 minutes, or until the syrup coats the back of a spoon.
Add the coconut, pecans, vanilla, and stir to combine. Tips – If you're toasting the coconut, do so in a dry skillet for a minute or two, or as long as it's necessary for it to lightly toast before adding it here. Be careful though because coconut burns fast due to the high sugar content. I personally don't bother toasting it, but you can if desired.
Evenly spread the frosting, as desired, over each cookie. Tip – Make sure cookies are sufficiently cooled before you add the warm frosting so it doesn't just melt more and slide right off.
Chocolate Ganache, optional – To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add the chocolate chips, heavy cream, and heat in 10 to 15-second bursts, or until chocolate can be stirred smooth. Tip – Don't try to do it too quickly or the chips won't melt and will simply burn.
Using a small spoon, evenly drizzle a bit of chocolate over the top of each cookie before serving.

Chocolate Peppermint Kiss Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 08, 2024",5,1,Cookies,15 minutes,10 minutes,Additional Time: 10 minutes minutes,Total Time: 35 minutes minutes,24 servings,16,"Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment or Silpal liners; set aside.
To a small microwave-safe bowl, add the chopped chocolate, and heat on high power to melt in 30 seconds intervals, stopping to check after each interval, and stirring until smooth and melted; set aside. Tips – You want to use chopped chocolate from a bar, rather than chocolate chips, because the chocolate will melt much easier and smoothly. I like Trader Joe's Pound Plus Dark Chocolate Bars or a Ghirardelli Semi Sweet Bar. You can use darker chocolate bars such as 72% chocolate (cookies will be less sweet) or milk chocolate bars (cookies will be sweeter), depending on preference.
To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, ½ granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cream them (a verb, not an ingredient) on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes until smooth, light, and fluffy. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the egg, vanilla extract, peppermint extract* (read the Notes), and mix momentarily to incorporate.
Add the melted chocolate and mix momentarily to incorporate. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl; set batter aside.
In a separate large bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder (Tips – I use Hershey's but you can use something fancier if you like such as Scharffen Berger; Dutch process cocoa has not been tested nor necessary for this recipe), baking powder, salt, and whisk to combine.
Slowly, add the dry ingredients to the wet, in 3 additions, stopping to beat the dry ingredients into the wet on low speed with your mixer, until just combined, but don't overmix; and repeating twice more, or until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated.
Optionally, but recommended, add the crushed candy cane bits, and mix for a couple seconds to incorporate. Tips – Crush candy canes in a sealed ziptop plastic bag with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer tool, placing the bag on a cutting board, and a kitchen towel over the top, to protect your counters and the contents in the bag. To save time, I like using already crushed candy bits. They keep forever and are great to have for holiday baking needs. Brach's Peppermint Candies (or similar peppermint candies) also work well here and are less seasonally dependent than actual candy canes or candy cane bits.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form rounded 1-tablespoon mounds of dough. Tips – I make 24 cookies with this recipe and while you could make the cookies bigger or smaller, for the positioning and size-proportionality later on with the Hershey's Kiss, I think it's best to aim for about 24 cookies.
Add the extra ⅓ cup granulated sugar to a small bowl and gently but thoroughly roll each cookie dough ball through the sugar.
Place the cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, divided and spaced evenly. I bake 12 cookies per sheet because the cookies are on the smaller side and don't spread excessively. Tip – You do not need to chill the cookie dough before baking in this recipe.
Bake for about 8 to 10 minutes, taking care not to overbake the cookies. Tips – I bake one sheet at a time, on the center oven rack, rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking. I find I get the best results this way. It's a bit tricky to tell when chocolate cookies are done, because the dough is already dark. In general though, chocolate cookies with cocoa powder can tend to bake quicker than you think, and also dry out quicker than you think, so if in doubt, pull them sooner rather than later. Cookies always firm up, harden, and are dryer out of the oven.
While the cookies bake, unwrap all the Hershey's Candy Cane Kisses and have them ready. Tip – If you can't find these locally or don't want to order them, another favorite type of Kiss may be used from classic milk chocolate to white chocolate.
As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, gently press a Kiss into the center of each cookie, making sure to press it down just firmly enough that the bottom surface of the Kiss is securely in contact with the top of the cookie so that the Kisses melt just enough to adhere well upon cooling.
Allow cookies to cool on a cooling rack after about 5-10 minutes on the baking sheet before enjoying.
Storage – Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Cookie dough balls may also be frozen and then baked off, as desired. When baking from frozen, you don't have to allow the dough balls to thaw and can bake directly from frozen, adding a minute or two to the overall baking time, or as necessary.",13,"▢ 2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate – chopped, melted, and slightly cooled (use a chocolate bar, not chocolate chips, for best results)","▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature","▢ ½ cup granulated sugar + ⅓ cup more, for rolling","▢ ½ cup light brown sugar, packed","▢ 1 large egg, at room temperature",▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/chocolate-peppermint-kiss-cookies/,"▢ ¾ teaspoon peppermint extract*, do NOT use more; see Notes",▢ 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour,▢ ¼ cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder,▢ 1 ½ teaspoon baking powder,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,"▢ ⅓ cup crushed candy canes, optional but recommended",▢ 24 Hershey’s Candy Cane Kisses,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Nov 11, 2025",4.86,7,Cookies,15 minutes,8 minutes,Chill Time: 1 hour hour,Total Time: 1 hour hour 23 minutes minutes,20 servings,11,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, sugars, and beat on high speed untii pale and creamy, about 3-4 minutes; stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the egg, vanilla, and beat on high speed to incorporate and until creamy, about 1-2 minutes; stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and beat for 1 minute to incorporate.
Add the white chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, and beat for an additional 30-60 seconds, or until the flour and add-ins have been completely incorporated; do not overmix.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to chill for 30-45 minutes. Tips – Do not skip the step of chilling the dough because your cookies will be much more prone to spreading during baking. However, don't chill for long because the dough will become too firm and it'll be like chiseling rather than scooping it out. You can also chill it in the freezer for about 20 minutes if you have the freezer space to do so.
Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners; set aside.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form cookie dough balls each using approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons dough (I made 20 balls). The overall yield will depend on the exact size of your dough balls.
Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spaced at least 2 inches apart.
Bake for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden browned and set. Baking Tips – Do not overbake. Cookies will continue to firm up as they are out of the oven and cooling, so it's ok to pull your baking sheets even if the cookies appear slightly undone. These cookies taste best when they're slightly underbaked rather than overbaked. Plus, white chocolate is prone to scorching and doesn't look very pretty if you overbake it. For optimal results, I bake cookies on the middle oven rack, one sheet at a time, rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking. The unevenness of your oven's heat output and air circulation (all ovens have this problem, some more so than others) will be very notable on white/light colored cookies like this, which is why I recommend rotating your baking sheets and only baking one sheet at a time so you can really pay attention to what's happening. If you made your cookies smaller/bigger than mine, baking time will vary. Bake as necessary in your oven; baking times listed are an estimate only.
Optionally, immediately after the cookies come out of the oven, if desired you can add a half dozen white chocolate chips to each cookie for beautification. Barely tap them in and they will melt a bit and adhere.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes, or until firm enough to transfer to wire racks to cool completely.",10,"▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temp",▢ ½ cup granulated sugar,"▢ ½ cup light brown sugar, packed",▢ 1 large egg,▢ 1 to 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,▢ 1 ½ cups cups all-purpose flour,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/white-chocolate-macadamia-nut-cookies/,▢ ½ teaspoon baking soda,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ 1 cup white chocolate chips,"▢ ½ cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped (I use dry roasted and lightly sea salted macadamias)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, granulated sugar, vanilla, and beat together on medium-high speed until fluffy and creamy. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Note – There is no egg nor brown sugar in this recipe, it's not a typo.
Add the dry ingredients in two additions to the wet, beating on low speed after each additon until just incorporated and repeat until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated; don't overmix. Tip – The dough will be stiff and thick; this is normal. If you're using a hand mixer, you may need to get in there with a wooden spoon and some elbow grease!
Shaping the Dough – You have two choices. You can either roll the dough into a long cylinder, about 2-inches in diameter, and tightly wrap in like a tootsie roll in parchment paper. OR you can roll it out in between two pieces of parchment to 1/4-inch thickness.
Refrigeration – Either way (log or flat piece of dough), you need to chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners; set aside.
Making the Cookie Shapes – If you made a log, slice off pieces that are 1/2-inch thick, and place them on the baking sheets, evenly spaced. If you are making cutout cookies, use the cookie cutters of your choice and cut them out. I suggest cutters that are about 2 1/2-3 inches in diameter. I used small stars. You can reroll the dough scraps once and cut out the remaining cookies that you can.
Optionally (but recommended) sprinkle the cookies with coarse sugar. You can optionally sprinkle them with sprinkles or jimmies, as desired.
Baking – Bake the cookies for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until set. Tips – Exact baking time will depend on exactly how thick you sliced the log or how large your cutout shapes are; as well as climate and oven variances. Bake one sheet of cookies at a time, on the middle rack, rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking for the most optimal results. If you made larger cookies, they may take longer than 10 minutes to cook. Do not overbake. Cookies will continue to firm and set up as they cool.
Dusting – If desired, you can lightly dust the cookies with confectioners' sugar after they have cooled completely.",12,▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,▢ ½ cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder,▢ 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon,▢ ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg,▢ ½ teaspoon cayenne,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/mexican-chocolate-shortbread-cookies/,▢ ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper,"▢ 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",▢ ¾ cup granulated sugar,▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,"▢ Coarse sugar, for sprinkling; optional but recommended","▢ Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Note – There is no brown sugar in this recipe as written. However, if you'd like to use 1/2 cup granulated sugar + 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, it will work fine.
Add the molasses, egg, vanilla, and beat to just incorporate. Tip – When measuring molasses, first spray your measuring cup with cooking spray and the molasses will slide right out.
Add the flour, all spices, salt, and beat on low speed to incorporate until a smooth dough forms; don't overmix.
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours to chill the dough. Tip – Do not skip the chilling step or cookies will spread a lot during baking. I prefer to chill them in the fridge than the freezer because the dough chills more uniformly.
After two hours, preheat the oven to 350F, line two baking sheets with parchment or a Silpat.
Use a small cookie scoop to form approximately 24 mounds of dough. The dough mounds will be about 1 inch in diameter, or about 1 tablespoon in size.
Place approximately 12 cookie dough balls on each baking sheet, or spaced evenly and as necessary.
Bake for about 8 minutes, or until done. Baking Tips – If you make larger cookies, they will take longer to cook. As written, 1-inch cookie dough balls are pretty small cookies by today's standards and bake quickly, in just about 8 minutes, but all ovens vary. It's okay to pull cookies when they appear barely set because they'll continue to firm up as they cool. If possible, I suggest baking one baking sheet of cookies at a time, on the middle oven rack, rotating the baking sheet once midway through cooking for the most uniform baking results. Repeat with second baking sheet.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5-10 minuts, or until they're cool enough to remove with a spatula and place on a wire race to cool completely.
Eggnog Frosting – Techinically this is optional but I highly recommend it! To a large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), add the cream cheese and beat on high speed for 1-2 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the confectioners' sugar, eggnog, and beat on low speed at first, gradually increasing the speed, until a smooth frosting has formed. Tips – The exact amount of eggnog (or milk) you need will depend on how thick or thin you like your frosting, your ingredients, and climate. Add additional liquid 1 tablespoon at a time if frosting is too thick; add confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons at a time if frosting is too thin or runny.
Using a small spoon, knife, offset spatula, or small spatula, add a bit of frosting to the top of each cookies. Note – This frosting is not meant to be piped. It's applied casually and rustically. If desired, add sprinkles now.
The frosting will set on its own at room temp in a few hours, but you can accelerate the process by placing the cookies in the fridge for about 15 minutes.
Serving – I serve the cookies at room temp because they taste best to me, but some people may prefer them chilled.",16,"▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, softened",▢ ¾ cup granulated sugar,▢ ¼ cup unsulphered molasses,▢ 1 large egg,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/gingerbread-molasses-cookies/,▢ 1 teaspoon baking soda,▢ 1 teaspoon baking powder,"▢ 1 to 2 teaspoons ground ginger, I use 2 but add to taste",▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon,"▢ ½ teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste","▢ ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste",▢ ½ teaspoon salt,"▢ 8 ounces brick-style cream cheese, full fat only","▢ 2 cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted recommended","▢ 2 tablespoons eggnog, or as desired (2% or whole milk may be substituted)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Pumpkin Snickerdoodle Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Oct 09, 2025",4.88,8,Cookies,15 minutes,10 minutes,Additional Time: 1 hour hour,Total Time: 1 hour hour 25 minutes minutes,16 servings,12,"Cookie Dough – To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl with handheld electric mixer), add the melted and cooled (make sure it's cool or you will scramble the egg), sugars, and beat on medium-high speed until well combined. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the pumpkin puree and beat to incorporate.
Add the egg yolk, vanilla, and beat to incorporate. Stop and scape down the sides of the bowl. Set aside momentarily.
In a separate large mixing bowl, add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves, cream of tartar *(See Notes) salt, and whisk to combine. Spices Tips – I add extra cinnamon and cloves because I am fond of the flavor. However, most blends of ""pumpkin pie spice"" contain a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and sometimes lemon peel. Therefore, if you want to just add a bit more pumpkin pie spice if you don't have individual spices, go for it. And/or add other spices to your liking, i.e. ground ginger, ground nutmeg, etc. It's all personal preference.
Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and beat on low speed to just incorporate; do not overmix.
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Chilling Tips – If you don't have room for the whole mixing bowl, make a dough mound and wrap that in plastic wrap, and then place it in the fridge. You MUST chill the dough because it's far too soft to bake with at this point and your cookies will spread horribly if you attempt it. You can chill the dough longer than 2 hours (up to 24-36 hours before baking it) however if you plan to chill for more than 2 hours, form the cookie dough mounds or balls within the 2 hour window or else the dough could become unreasonably stiff and difficult to work with.
After 1-2 hours, remove the dough from the fridge, and using a medium cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) and form approximately 16 equal sized balls of dough. Give each ball a quick roll between your palms to smooth; set aside on baking sheets momentarily.
Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with Silpat baking mats, parchment paper, or spray the baking sheets well with nonstick spray.
Cinnamon-Sugar – To a medium bowl (not too small because you have to roll the dough balls through it), add the graulated sugar, cinnamon, and stir to combine.
Roll each mound of dough through the cinnamon sugar, and place about 8 mounds per baking sheet, evenly spaced. You do not need to flatten the dough mounds.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or as needed until done. Baking Tips – I always perfer baking one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center rack, and I rotate it midway through the baking time for the most even baking. However, you can bake two sheets at once if preferred. Baking time is just an estimate or guideline, and your cookies may take more or less time to bake depending on your oven, how cold the dough was going into the oven, the exact size of your cookie dough balls, etc. Cookies are done when they are set on the top and lightly golden browned and will have the tell-tale crinkling of a snickerdoodle cookie, although that also continues to develop at the cookies cool.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5-10 minutes, or until cool and set enough to transfer to wire racks, where they can cool completely. Cinnamon-Sugar Tip – Sometimes it can seem that the cinnamon-sugar coating almost disappears during the baking process. But don't worry if that happens to you! Simply sprinkle the baked cookies with an extra large pinch of cinnamon-sugar right after you pull them out of them oven while they're cooling on the baking sheets.",15,"▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled",▢ ½ cup granulated sugar,"▢ ⅓ cup light brown sugar, packed","▢ ¼ cup pure pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling","▢ 1 egg yolk, from a large egg (discard white or save for your morning eggs)",▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/pumpkin-snickerdoodles/,▢ 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour,▢ 2 ½ teaspoons pumpkin spice,"▢ ½ to 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste",▢ ½ teaspoon baking soda,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ ¼ teaspoon ground cloves,▢ ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar*,▢ ⅓ to ½ cup granulated sugar,▢ 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chop 6 strips of the bacon into small pieces about the size of chocolate chips; set aside.
Very finely mince the other 2 strips of bacon. This will be used as a garnish on the cookies after baking; set aside. Tip – Do not mingle the bacon after you chop it since 6 strips of it goes into the batter and 2 strips of it is reserved for garnishing.
Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners; set aside.
To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer), add the butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla, and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes; stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, optional table salt, and beat on low speed to incorporate; stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add half the chopped chocolate, all the butterscotch chips, the 6 strips of chopped bacon, and beat on low to just incorporate.
Optionally, at this point you can chill the mixing bowl of dough in your fridge for up to 1 hour. This will help prevent the cookies from spreading somewhat as they bake, but it's optional.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form approximately 12 balls of dough, using about 2 to 3 tablespoons of dough per cookie dough ball.
Roll each ball in a bit of the reserved chopped chocolate.
Evenly space the cookie dough balls on the two baking sheets. Tip – These cookies do spread, even if you chill the dough, so don't crowd them on the baking sheet. I suggest baking 6 cookies (8 max) per baking sheet.
Bake for about 10 to 14 minutes, or until the edges have just barely set, and the tops are glossy. Cookies will looks very glossy and under-done when you pull them from the oven, but they do firm up as the cool. Tips – Watch your cookies and not the clock in determining doneness. All ovens, climates, baking sheets, and ingredients vary, and therefore so will baking time. For best results, bake one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center oven rack, rotating once midway through the baking time for optimal results. Repeat with the second sheet of cookies.
Optionally but recommended, when you remove the trays of cookies from the oven, give the trays a couple taps on your counter, making sure to have a firm hold on the trays with hot mitts. This shakes out air and settles the cookies.
While the chocolate is still melted and warm, evenly sprinkle the tops of the cookies with the finely minced bacon from the 2 strips of cooked bacon.
Optionally, evenly sprinkle the cookies with Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, your favorite sea salt, or coarse salt if you don't have sea salt on hand.
Serve after cookies are cooled and set fully. Because they are thin, they'll break more easily if they're not properly cooled before serving. These cookies are best eaten the day you make them, or within 24 hours. Extra cookies should be kept airtight in the fridge, where they'll keep for up to 3 days. I haven't ever frozen these cookies, either unbaked dough or baked cookies, so cannot comment how that would work. In my opinion, this is a recipe you should plan to make and consume, rather than store long-term.",12,"▢ 8 strips of cooked bacon, divided and diced*","▢ ½ cup salted butter, softened (unsalted butter may be used if you want to reduce the overall saltiness of the cookies)","▢ ½ cup dark brown sugar, packed (light brown sugar may be substituted)",▢ 1 large egg,▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla,▢ 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/bacon-chocolate-chip-cookies/,▢ ½ teaspoon baking soda,▢ ½ teaspoon baking powder,"▢ ½ teaspoon fine table salt, omit if you want to reduce the overall saltiness of the cookies","▢ 3.5 ounces dark chocolate bar, finely chopped**, divided","▢ ½ cup butterscotch chips, finely chopped","▢ Flakey sea salt, optional for garnishing (omit if you want to reduce the overall saltiness of the cookies)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Note – Cream is a verb, not a noun. There is no cream used in this recipe. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the eggs, vanilla, and beat to combine, about 2 minutes. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl; set aside.
In a separate large bowl, combine all the remaining dry ingredients, and whisk to mix and combine.
With the mixer running on low, slowly add the dry ingredients in the wet, and beat until all the dry flour mixture has been integrated; don't overmix.
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat baking mats, and using a large cookie scoop, form evenly sized mounds of dough. Tip – These are big cookies in the typical style of Crumbl Cookies, about 3 tablespoons of dough each. You can make the cookies smaller but I prefer this larger size in truer keeping with the bakery version and yield 16 cookies.
Press the dough balls down until they are about 1/4-inch tall (or high).
Using the back of dinner knife or a chopstick (you can use a toothpick but you'll need to retrace the spiral swirl a few times to get it wide enough), make a spiral swirl starting in the center of each cookie, and working outward. Tip – See the process photos in the blog post for guidance.
Place the baking sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes or in the refrigerators for 45-60 minutes to chill the dough. Chilling Tips – If you don't have space in your freezer or fridge to accommodate two large baking sheets, that's fine. Transfer the cookies to a dinner plate or whatever you have that will fit in your allocated space. It's okay if the cookie dough is touching side-by-side on the dinner plate while it's chilling. Don't skip chilling the dough or the cookies will spread as they bake.
While the cookies chill, preheat the oven to 350F.
Bake the cookies for about 13 to 15 minutes, or until just set and done. Tips – If you can, bake the cookies one baking sheet at a time, on the center oven rack, rotating the sheet once, midway through baking, for optimal results. Start checking early since all ovens and exact size of cookies will vary. Bake until the edges are just starting to turn lightly golden brown, but do not overbake. Cookies may look underdone when you pull them from the oven but will continue to bake on the hot cookie sheet even after you pull it from the oven and then continue to firm up as they cool.
Allow cookies to cool for about 10 minutes on the baking sheets, and then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. Tip – Do not glaze warm cookies or it will just slide right off and you'll have to start over.
To a large mixing bowl, add all the glaze ingredients, and whisk to combine. Tip – It's very important to use well softened butter or this task is much more difficult than it needs to be. You can also beat the glaze together using a handheld electric mixer, although I don't find it's necessary.

Add the rainbow sprinkles and fold gently to combine; don't overmix. Tip – I find name brand sprinkles like Betty Crocker or Wilton to run or bleed into the batter or on top of frosting less than generic brands, but use what you trust.
It's highly recommended to prevent cookie spreading, but not absolute, but I suggest placing your mixing bowl in the fridge to chill for about 1 hour.
Using a
3-tablespoon large cookie scoopor two actual tablespoons, form cookie dough mounds, and place them on the prepared baking sheets.
Tips
– Do not crowd your baking sheets. I suggest baking only 6 cookies per sheet since these are big cookies and even if you chill the dough, they still spread to a degree.
Bake cookies for 9 minutes, rotating the pan once, midway through cooking. Tips – For optimal results, bake one sheet at a time, on the middle rack. If you must, it's fine to bake two sheets at once, but I suggest then not only rotating your baking sheets 180 degrees, but also swap them onto the other rack, i.e. whatever was on top, switch to the bottom rack, midway through baking. This is because all ovens bake differently and I find the sheet of cookies that's on the bottom, never bakes quite as nicely as the one on top so this is my trick to combat that phenomenon. Make sure to bake cookies for about about 9 minutes, and do not overbake, even if they look underdone when you pull them. They'll continue to set up on the baking sheets as they cool.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, or until set enough to transfer to wire racks to finish cooling complete. While they cool, make the frosting.
To a large mixing bowl, add the butter, cream cheese, and beat on high with a handheld electric mixer (or do this in your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and beat to incorporate, starting on low speed and increasing to high, until frosting is smooth.
Optionally, if you want to add food color in the color of your choice, add it now, drop by drop, mixing after each addition, until your desired shade is achieved. Crumbl Cookies traditionally uses baby pink frosting for this recipe, but I left my untinted.
Transfer the frosting to a large ziptop bag, seal it, and carefully snip off the tip of one of the bottom corners with a scissors, taking care not to make the hole too big. Alternatively, you can transfer the frosting to a piping bag, fitted with a coupler and Wilton 2A tip, or similar. Alternatively, you can simply spread the frosting on with a knife if you don't care about the piped swirled ""look"".
Starting in the center of one cookie, make a circular pattern, going outward. Repeat until all cookies have been frosting.
Evenly garnish with confetti sprinkles. Tip – If you don't want to buy separate sprinkles for the cookie dough and for garnishing on top, I recommend just then buying rainbow sprinkles and using them for both the batter and garnishing.
Storage – Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for 2-3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, if you don't like to keep frosted baked goods at room temp. I recommend storing them flat in one layer, rather than stacking them, so the frosting doesn't transfer and get messy. Once frosted, the cookies aren't good for freezing. Baked, but unfrosted, cookies will keep airight in the freezer for up to 2 months.",12,▢ 2 large eggs,▢ ⅓ cup vegetable or canola oil,"▢ one 16-ounce box cake mix, white or confetti*",▢ 1 teaspoon baking powder,▢ ¼ cup rainbow sprinkles or jimmies,"▢ 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temp",Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/confetti-cake-cookies/,"▢ 4 ounces original brick-style cream cheese, softened to room temp (do NOT use lite, reduced fat, or any cream cheese product labeled as ‘spreadable’ or ‘whipped’)","▢ 1 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted if it’s lumpy",▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ ¼ teaspoon salt,"▢ Food coloring of choice, optional","▢ ¼ cup confetti sprinkles, rainbow sprinkles or jimmies may be substituted",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Homemade Nutter Butter Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 08, 2024",4.41,5,Cookies,20 minutes,10 minutes,Additional Time: 30 minutes minutes,Total Time: 1 hour hour,Servings: 8,15,"Preheat oven to 350F, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a Silpat liner; set aside.
Cookies - To a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients and beat by hand to combine (stiff at first but very do-able) or with a handheld electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
Using a small cookie scoop, form 1/2-teaspoon sized cookie dough balls, and place them on the prepared baking tray. Ideally, you'll make about 32 small cookie dough balls.
When placing the cookie dough balls on the baking sheet, place them in pairs, so that two dough balls are touching. See photos in the blog post for a great visual reference. Evenly space the pairs over the baking sheets. This should make approximately 16 cookies.
Using the base of a drinking glass or 1-cup measure, flatten the pairs of dough balls to about 1/4 to 1/8-inch in thickness. Tips - At this point you should have a ""Mr. Peanut"" shaped looking mounds of dough. If you don't, you can pinch the ""waist"" or junction point of the cookies a bit with your fingers to accentuate this.
Dip the tines of a fork into flour and make the classic crisscross pattern into the cookie dough by going vertically from end to end, and then crosshatching horizontally from side to side. Make sure to use gluten-free flour if you need the cookies to be gluten free.
Bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the cookies are set and done; the longer you bake them, the crunchier they will be which is fine, but don't burn them. Tips - Bake one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center oven rack, rotating the baking sheet once midway through baking for optimal results.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until they're cool enough to remove. Tip - If you place the cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes, this helps reduce breaking later on when you're spreading the filling onto them. And it also helps the optional melted chocolate set more quickly.
Filling - Add the peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup or honey, and mix aggressively to incorporate. If the mixture is very thick and too stiff to mix, add 1 additional tablespoon of the maple syrup or honey, and mix to incorporate.
Assembly - Spread a layer of filling on the underside of one cookie, pair it with another cookie, underside to underside; and repeat until all cookies have been filled and sandwiched together; yielding about 8 finished sandwich cookies.
Toppings - Optionally, melt the Ghirardelli Melting Wafers according to package directions OR melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 20-second bursts, stopping to stir after each bursts, until the chocolate chips can be stirred smooth; don't overheat.
Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cookies as desired. And/or dip one tip of the cookies into the chocolate. If you plan to dip a significant portion of cookies rather than drizzle, you'll need to melt additional chocolate.
Optionally, sprinkle with flaky sea salt as desired.
Allow the cookies to set up fully at room temp before serving. Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 1 week, in the freezer for up to 4 months. Unbaked balls of cookie dough will also keep airtight in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw before baking to cold room temperature, enough to flatten paired cookie dough balls before baking as instructed above.

Shortbread Sandwich Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 08, 2024",5,1,NA,30 minutes,12 minutes,Additional Time: 2 hours hours,Total Time: 2 hours hours 42 minutes minutes,42 cookies (21 sandwiches),20,"Cookies - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or a large mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer, add the butter and beat on high speed until light, fluffy, and creamy. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the confectioners' sugar, and beat on low speed to begin so sugar doesn't fly, increasing to high speed, and beat to incorporate.
Add the eggs, vanilla, and beat on high speed until smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, baking powder, and salt little by little, beating on low speed as you add it, until the dry ingredients are just incorporated, don't overmix.
Turn out the dough into a flattened mound, wrap it well in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 24 hours.
Rolling Out - After the dough has chilled and you plan to roll it out, preheat the oven to 350F.
Generously flour your clean kitchen countertop or work surface, and roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thick. Tips - If you've chilled the dough overnight or for a longer duration, allow the dough to sit at room temp for about 10 to 15 minutes before you attempt to roll it out since it'll be very hard and stiff. However, if you've only chilled 1 hour or a bit more, get going right away with rolling it out and don't wait.
Using a 2-inch fluted biscuit cutter (or your favorite circular cutter or other shaped cookie cutter such as trees or stars) cut out the cookies as close together as possible.
Place the cut cookies on Silpat or parchment lined baking sheets, evenly spaced and with some room to spread a bit while baking.
Mound up the unused dough scraps into a ball, roll out the dough once more, cut out as many cookies as you can, and place those on baking sheets as well.
Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies are very lighlly golden browned around the edges, taking care not to overbake because the cookies will continue to firm up and darken a bit as they cool. Tips - Baking times will vary dramatically based on oven and climate variance, and the exact sizes/shapes you make your cookies, so watch your cookies and not the clock when determining doneness and bake as long as necessary given your set of variables. Finally, I find that baking one sheet of cookies at a time, in the center oven rack, and rotating the baking sheet midway through gives the most optimal results.
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until they're firm enough to transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Don't start the next step until they're fully cooled.
Semi-Sweet Chocolate Filling - To a large microwave-safe bowl, add the chocolate chips, butter, and heat on high power to melt for 30 seconds. Stop to check and stir. Heat in 15-second bursts, stopping to check and stir after each burst, until the chocolate can be stirred smooth.
Assembly - Using a butter knife, spread a thin layer of melted chocolate on the underside of one cookie, pair it with another cookie, sandwiching the two undersides together like a sandwich.
Repeat with all remanning cookies. Allow the chocolate to fully set up before moving on to the next step.
White Chocolate Coating (optional but recommended for both appearance and flavor) - Melt the white chocolate melting wafers* (See Notes) according to package directions.
Using a fork, place one sandwich cookie on it, dip into the white chocolate quickly but enough to fully coat the cookie, and allow the excess chocolate to drip off through the tines of the fork back into the bowl. Set dipped cookies on a wire rack to fully set up and repeat with all remaining cookies.
Decorating (optional) - If you'd like to add holiday sprinkles or whatever kind you'd like, add them before the white chocolate sets so they adhere. I strongly recommend you do this for a festive look.
If you'd like to make colored drizzles of red and green as shown in the photos, do so by placing extra melted white chocolate in two small bowls, add green gel food color to one, and red gel food color to the other (regular food color is fine but gel is nicer in that it doesn't water down the chocolate and the color is richer), transfer to two small ziptop bags, seal, snip the tiniest tip off the corners of each, and drizzle as desired. Repeat as desired.
Storage - Allow cookies to fully set before serving. Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for 5 to 7 days (fresher is always better) or in the freezer for up to 3 months, noting that any time cookies thaw, condensation will form. It's totally normal but the appearance may not be quite as pristine as had they never been frozen although the taste will be fine.",14,"▢ ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature","▢ ¾ cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted",▢ 2 large eggs,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 3 cups all-purpose flour,▢ 1 teaspoon baking powder,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/shortbread-sandwich-cookies/,▢ ¼ teaspoon salt,▢ ¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (milk chocolate chips may be substituted,▢ 1 teaspoon unsalted butter,▢ two 10-ounce bags white chocolate melting wafers,▢ OR,▢ 2 ½ cups white chocolate bar or white chocolate chips + 1 tablespoon coconut oil,"▢ Food coloring, red and green, or as desired","▢ Holiday sprinkles, or as desired",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Snowflake Sugar Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Oct 21, 2024",4.86,7,NA,30 minutes,9 minutes,Additional Time: 2 hours hours,Total Time: 2 hours hours 39 minutes minutes,Servings: 24,17,"Cookies – To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and handheld mixer), add the butter, and beat on high speed until light and fluffy. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Sift in the confectioners' sugar, beat on low at first so it doesn't fly everywhere, then increase the speed to high and beat until very light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the vanilla extract and beat momentarily to incorporate. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and beat to just incorporate, don't overmix. The dough will be very thick.
Add the milk, 1 tablespoon at t time, mixing briefly after each tablespoon, until a thick but smooth dough can come together.
Notes – You may not need all of the milk, so don't add it if you don't need it. Stop adding it after your dough has come together. I doubt you will need more milk than called for, but perhaps if you have a very thick or crumbly dough (remember not to over-measure/pack in the flour when you're adding it in the previous step to prevent an overly dry dough) add a bit more milk until your dough comes together.
Take the dough out of the mixer, divide it in half (approximately), pat the dough into large thick disc shapes, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight, to chill.
After the dough has chilled at least 1 hour and you're ready to rol it out, preheat the oven to 350F.
Remove the dough from the fridge, generously flour a clean countertop so the dough doesn't stick, and roll the dough out to approximately 1/8-inch thick.
Tip – If you've been chilling the dough for longer than about 3 hours (especially if you chilled it overnight) give it about 15 minutes at room temp before you attempt to roll it out.
Using snowflake cookie cutters (or your favorite shape of cutters), cut out snowflake shapes, wasting as little dough as possible and cutting as closely as possible to form the snowflakes.
Tips – You can ball up and then reroll your scraps of dough. However, I only reroll once. After that the dough gets a bit overworked and isn't at its best. Make whatever shape of circular cookie(s) you'd like for the final bits of dough and call it a day is my advice..
Place the cut snowflakes on parchment paper lined or Silpat lined baking mats on baking sheets and bake for approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Baking time will vary considerably based on the size of your snowflakes (or other shapes of cookies), oven and climate variances, etc. Pay close attention to your cookies in your oven, and pull them when the edges are just barely turning golden brown. Cookies will continue to set, firm up, and darken in color as they cool.
Tips – I suggest baking one tray of cookies at one time, on the center oven rack, and rotating once midway through baking for best results.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until they've firmed up enough to carefully transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
Frosting – Read the 'Notes' at the bottom of this post to see what frostings you can buy or make. Spread a thin layer of frosting using a butter knife or small spatula over the surface of every cookie. Fun Tip – You can color the frosting red, green, or another color of your choice with food coloring if you'd like.
Spread a thin layer of frosting using a butter knife or small spatula over the surface of every cookie.
Piping– To pipe the frosting you've made, transfer it into a pastry bag (or the tip of your choice) onto the bag, and begin to pipe small stars over the surface of every cookie.
As desired, add sprinkles to the top of each cookie. Fun Tip – Feel free to use Christmas colored sprinkles, or whatever color and type of sprinkles you'd like.
Shortcut Frosting – The third and final option for frosting is to use another favorite store bought frosting like buttercream. You cannot pipe the frosting, so just spread it on the cookies with a butter knife or small spatula, and add sprinkles as desired.
Storage – The vanilla whipped cream frosted cookies need to be stored airtight in the fridge where they will keep for 3 to 4 days.
If you use homemade vanilla buttercream, you can feel confident leaving them airtight at room temp for up to 5 days or in the fridge for up to 1 week.
If you use store bought frosting the cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 1 week.",8,"▢ 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature","▢ 1 ½ cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted",▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 3 cups all-purpose flour,▢ 1 teaspoon baking powder,▢ ¼ teaspoon salt,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/snowflake-sugar-cookies/,"▢ 5 tablespoons whole milk, as needed",▢ 3 options See Notes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric handheld mixer), add the butter, and beat on high speed for about 1 to 2 minutes, or until soft, fluffy, and creamy. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add 1 cup confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and initially beat on low speed to incorporate the sugar, and then ramp up to high speed until the mixture is soft and fluffy. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the dry ingredients mixture (flour, nuts, salt) and mix to just incorporate; don't overmix.
Using a small 1-tablespoon cookie scoop or similar, form approximately 24 equally sized mounds of dough, place them on a large dinner plate, cover with plasticwrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or longer (up to 3 days**). Tips – Do NOT chill the whole bowl of dough and then later on try to later scoop it out because it'll be dry, crumbly, difficult to work with, and this chiseling method is not advised. Use a large dinner plate and find some space in your fridge for 30 to 60 minutes to chill the dough.
While the dough is chilling or before you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 400F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpats; set aside. Note – You can also use a 375F oven rather than 400F. The cookies will take longer to bake but will be less prone to burning on the bottoms and you won't need to watch them quite as carefully.
Place the chilled cookie dough mounds on the baking sheets. Tips – I bake about 12 cookies per sheet. They don't spread much. I bake them one sheet at a time in the center oven rack, rotating the pan once midway through baking, for optimal results. I try to avoid baking two sheets of cookies at once because the sheet baking on the bottom tends to not turn out quite as well as the other sheet.
If you're baking at 400F, the cookies will bake for about 7 to 10 minutes. At 375F, they'll bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Tips – Because this is quite a hot oven cookies, keep a very close eye on the cookies, especially the bottoms, and bake just until they are barely golden browned and the tops are set. The cookies will continue to firm up as the cool and the bottoms will also darken a bit more, so if in doubt, I recommend pulling them out sooner rather than later. Watch your cookies, in your oven, and not the clock when determining doneness since all ovens, baking sheets, climates, etc. vary so much.
Allow the cookies to cool for about 10 minutes on the baking sheet before rolling them in confectioners' sugar.
Add a generous amount (at least 1 cup) of confectioners' sugar to a small bowl, and roll each baked cookie though the sugar. Repeat, assembly line style, until they are all rolled.
Optional but recommended, roll all the cookies through additional confectioners' sugar a second time. Tips – I do this because in the first round of sugar rolling, the sugar tends to melt into the warm cookies a bit and while delicious, it doesn't give the visual cues of a really snow-covered snowball. For this reason, I roll twice. First round of rolling is for sweetness, second round also adds sweetness but adds the visual effect, too.
Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 10 days. Obviously cookies are best totally fresh, but as cookies go, snowballs are good keepers, making them great for cookie exchanges or as make-ahead cookies.** Baked snowball cookies will keep airtight in the freezer for up to 4 monhts.",6,▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour,"▢ ¾ cup pecans, or walnuts, finely chopped; toasted optional*",▢ ½ teaspoon salt,"▢ ¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature","▢ 1 cup confectioners’ sugar for the dough, sifted (plus more for rolling)",▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/snowball-cookies/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Christmas Shortbread Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Sep 24, 2025",5,10,NA,20 minutes,10 minutes,Additional Time: 30 minutes minutes,Total Time: 1 hour hour,14 servings,28,"Shortbread Cookies – To a large bowl (and bowl of a stand mixer), add the butter, granulated, sugar, vanilla extract, and beat on medium-high speed until creamy. Stop, scape down the sides, and set bowl aside.
To a separte bowl, add the flour, baking powder, salt, and whisk to combine.
Slowly, add the dry ingredients to the wet, alternating with 1 tablespoon of milk at a time, and beating on low speed, until you have a soft dough.
Transfer the dough to a clean working surface and divide the dough in half. Set one half aside on a clean work surface.
Place the other half back in your mixing bowl, and using gel blue food coloring (I used Wilton Royal Blue for this recipe, AmeriColor Blue is also good) dye that half blue. Add a few drops at a time and gently mix in, and keep adding drops until the desired color is achieved. Note – It is optional to dye the dough blue, and you can also use another color such as red or your favorite, or you can optionally skip dying the dough.
Place both the blue dough and the plain dough on a clean work surface. Tip– If you have a baking mat with measurements on it, it's very handy for this recipe.
Shape each mound of dough into an 8-inch log.
Then cut each log in half lengthwise. You'll now have 2 plain and 2 blue sections of dough.
Press 1 plain + 1 blue together. And repeat, and press the other plain + blue together.
Wrap each of these two bundles tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for at least 10 minutes or until slightly firm. Tip – Do not skip this step or your dough will be too mushy to cleanly slice and the cookies will also spread too much in the oven.
Preheat your oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
After about 10 minutes, or when the dough is slightly firm (it doesn't have to be in shouldn't be rock hard), remove it from the freezer, and slice the dough horizontally down each log in 1/4-inch slices. Press each down slightly with your palm, but don't over-flatten.
Place each doll mound on the prepared baking sheet, spaced 1 to 2 inches apart. Tip – The cookies don't spread very much, but to be safe if you're baking sheet is on the smaller size, use 2 baking sheets rather than cramming onto one.
Decorate with star-shaped sprinkles, or your favorite sprinkles or jimmies. If using stars, I use approximately 3 stars per cookie. I decorate the blue side, but you can decorate whichever side you prefer.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until set. Cookies will continue to firm up as the cool so don't be afraid to pull them even if they look slightly underdone. Allow cookies to cool completely on the baking sheets* See Notes for Baking Tips.
Optionally, dust the cookies now with confectioners' sugar. I always dust them again at the end.
Decorating – Note that if you do not plan to make or decorate with Christmas trees, you can skip this whole section below. Just dust with confectioner's sugar and serve.
While the cookies are cooling, melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in the microwave in 10-second bursts, stopping to stir after every burst. You can also melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of boiling water.
After the chocolate has melted, and has been stirred smooth, add gel green food coloring, until desired shade is reached (I used Wilton Green in the same set at the Royal Blue I used in the dough, AmeriColor in Forrest Green is also good).
Allow the green tinted white chocolate to continue to cool for a couple more minutes. If it's too warm, it's usually too thin and more difficult to use.
Making The Trees – Optional
Note that the trees are an optional step but do go along way in adding towards the fun and festive look!
I recommend starting with three straight green lines, each placed where you want a tree to be. I use the dividing line between the blue and plain dough for where I put the trees so the “roots” are just barely going into the plain and the tree and its branches will be in the blue section.
After drawing the lines, carefully start adding three more lines on each side of those original lines to create the outline of the branches.
Fill in with your toothpick, adding more green as necessary. 
Repeat on all the cookies.
Fixing “Mistakes” – If you make a mistake you can take a tiny section of lightly moistened paper towel and try to correct it if you really care that much if a quick wipe with your finger doesn’t do the trick. You don’t have to be Picasso!

Tip - I do not recommend making this in a full-size muffin pan because it's just simply too big and too much. However, if you do, you'll yield about 10 to 12 cups, and should bake them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're done.

Add the flour mixture and crushed Lucky Charms cereal (dry only, no marshmallows) until combined.** (See Notes)
Green Marbled Cookies – If you would like to make green and white marbled cookies, separate out about ⅓ of the dough and place it in a separate bowl. Add a dot of green food coloring to the small bowl of dough and mix until evenly colored and then carry on to step 7. If you are not making green marbled cookies, skip step 6 entirely and jump to step 7.
For both types of cookies plain and green marbled, add the marshmallows from the Lucky Charms cereal to the plain uncolored dough and fold together until incorporated. Note – For green marbled cookies, only add the marshmallows to the large, uncolored portion of plain dough and mix. Green Marbled Cookies – now jump to Step 11.
Plain Cookies – Using a large 3-tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop out 3 tablespoon-sized balls of dough and lightly flatten them into 2-inch discs.
Place the dough discs onto the parchment lined baking sheets about 3-inches apart to account for spreading.
Press several marshmallows partway into the top of the discs and baked for about 18 to 20 minutes. Tips – For optimal results, bake one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center oven rack, and rotate the baking sheet halfway through for even baking. For a flatter, chewier cookie, slam the baking sheet down onto the baking rack every few minutes after the cookies have been baking for 10 minutes until you pull them out of the oven. Don't overbake the cookies. It's okay to pull them when they look a bit glossy and underdone on tops as they will firm up as they cool.
Green Marbled Cookies – Scoop 1 tablespoon green dough and 2 tablespoons of plain dough. Gently roll the two doughs
together, side by side just until the doughs have melded together but are not mixed. Slightly flatten the balls into about 2” discs.
Place the discs onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Press several marshmallows onto the top of each disc.
Follow the baking directions in step 10 including baking for 18 to 20 minutes as well as the Tips indicated.
Both Types of Cookies – Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes or until you can transfer the to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.
Cookies will keep airtight at room temp for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough shaped in balls that are placed in an airtight container or ziplock will also keep for up to 4 months.Bake them off a few cookies at a time or as desired.

Add the flour mixture and beat until a smooth dough forms; don't overmix.
Divide the dough in two equal portions, pat into two balls, wrap each tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray, or line with Silpat mats; set aside.
On a lightly floured surface like a clean countertop, roll out the dough in a rough circle to ¼-inch thickness.
Cut out cookies using a coffee mug cookie cutter and transfer to the prepared baking sheets.
Ball up excess dough, re-roll it, cut out additional cookies, and transfer to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake for approximately 10 minutes, or until lightly golden browned around the edges. Start check at 8 minutes since all ovens bake differently. Tip - Bake one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center oven rack, rotating baking sheet once midway though baking for optimal results. Keep other cookie sheet in the fridge while waiting to bake if possible as cold dough bakes better.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets momentarily until they can be tranfserred to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cool, make the icing.
To a large bowl, add the confectioners’ sugar, meringue powder, and beat with a handheld electric mixer until combined.* (See Notes for meringue powder info)
Gradually add the WARM water and beat until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Add more sugar or water to achieve the proper consistency. Tip - The proper consistency for the icing is when you lift the beaters out of it, and the ribbon of icing that falls into the bowl remains on the surface of the icing for 2 to 3 seconds, and then disappears.
Tint ¾ of the icing with red food coloring gel. You will need about 1/8 teaspoon. I use Wilton Christmas Red Gel Color because it doesn't thin out the icing like non-gel food coloring and the shape of red is the perfect holiday color.
Transfer the red and the white icing into two separate pastry bags and get ready to use it immediately. Don't let it sit.
Use a #8 tip for outlining and filling the mug part of the cookie and a #32 tip for filling in the cream part. Tip - Wilton tips numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 work as well in place of the #8 tip.
Begin decorating your least favorite or least pretty looking cookies first. Outline the mug part of the cookie with red icing, then fill it in with red. Optional Tip - Sprinkle some coarse sugar over the red part of the mug before the icing sets up to give a bit more visual pop.
Fill in the cream part on the top of the mug with the white icing.
Draw a white snowflake in the center of the red mug portion. 
Optionally draw a thin horizontal line with thick caramel sauce between the mug and cream part. Trader Joe's or my Best and Easiest Salted Caramel Sauce work well.
Once you’ve finished applying the icing to the cookie, shake it very gently to help settle the bumps if there are any. Also, use a toothpick to help smooth out any lumps, bumps, or bubbles.
Repeat the process with all the cookies and allow them to set up fully before storing or enjoying.
I recommend storing your decorated holiday sugar cookies airtight at room temp for up to 5 days. While you can likely get away with storing them for up to 2 weeks at room temp, they won’t taste as fresh.
Once they’ve been decorated, do not freeze them because it will cause the icing to smear, run, and bleed together. Although, you can freeze the unbaked cut-out sugar cookie dough. Freeze it airtight in a large disc for up to 4 months, allow it to thaw on the counter, and then roll it out after it’s soft enough, and bake off your fun cut-out sugar cookies.",13,▢ 1 ¾ cups 224 grams all-purpose flour,▢ 1 teaspoon baking soda,▢ ⅛ teaspoon salt,"▢ ½ cup 113 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",▢ 1 cup 201 grams granulated sugar,▢ 1 large egg,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/cut-out-coffee-cup-cookies/,"▢ ¾ teaspoon lemon zest, optional",▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,"▢ 2 ¼ cups 190 grams confectioners’ sugar, sifted if lumpy",▢ 2 tablespoons Wilton meringue powder,▢ ¼ cup-1/2 cup lukewarm water,"▢ Red food coloring gel, I used Wilton Christmas Red color","▢ 2 tablespoons thick caramel sauce for decorating cookies, optional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a small cookie scoop, divide dough into 24 balls, or about 2 to 3 teaspoons of dough each. Tip – Do not make cookies bigger or smaller than indicated because it will throw off the ratios of jelly, baking times, risk for overflowing, etc.
Place 12 cookie dough balls on each baking sheet, spaced evenly.
Press your thumb into the middle of each ball of dough to create the indentation for the jelly. Press down about halfway taking care not to go too deep or too shallow.
Fill each indentation with no more than ½ teaspoon each of jelly. Evenly fill 8 indentations with raspberry jelly, 8 with strawberry jelly, and 8 with peach jelly.*

Scrape the sides down.
Add the molasses, egg yolks, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed for another minute to fully incorporate; set aside.
To a separate, medium sized bowl, whisk together the flour and the remaining dry ingredients.
Once combined, add to the wet ingredients.
Mix on medium-low speed to avoid whipping flour everywhere for about 1 minute or until the flour is just incorporated and then mix just until the flour is incorporated. Do not overmix as the cookies will become hard rather than soft and chewy.
Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and roll into a rough disc-like patty shape, about 3 or 4 inches thick. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to chill for at least one hour, or up to overnight.
Once the dough has chilled, remove it from the fridge, preheat the oven to 350F, and prep several baking sheet pans by lining them with Silpat liners or parchment paper and spraying them with baking spray; set aside.
Place the dough disc onto a lightly floured surface. For the first roll out, you can lightly sprinkle the top of the disc with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a rough rectangle about ⅛” thick.
Using a 3.75-inch gingerbread cookie cutter, cut as many cookies out of the dough as you can. Be sure not to overlap the cutter onto any of the previously cut out cookies. If you accidentally cut out one cookie on top of another, simply roll them back into the dough after you have removed all of the other good cookies.
Once you have cut out all the cookies possible, gently remove all of the remaining dough from around the cookies. Doing this makes it easier to pick the cookies up.
Place all of the cut out cookies onto the prepared baking sheets ensuring to space them about ½” apart.
Roll the remaining dough back into a ball to roll out again.
Cut out as many cookies as possible before repeating the same steps until all of the cookie dough is used. I don't re-roll the dough additionally after this second roll out because there's usually hardly enough left to bother. But do as you see fit for the amount of dough you have leftover.
Place into the oven to bake for 8-9 minutes. The cookies will still be soft and may not be browned around the edges when they are baked, this is fine. The longer you bake these cookies, the harder and crunchier they get. Tip – For optimal results, bake one sheet of cookies at a time, in the center rack, rotating once midway though cooking. If you have the space for it in your fridge, place the cookie sheets in waiting in the fridge; if not that's fine. Cold dough always spreads less than warm dough.
Once baked, remove from the oven and place onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Cool cookies completely before icicng them. While you wait, make the icing.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the confectioners' sugar and salt.
Add the corn syrup, vanilla, and whisk.
Add the milk and whisk extremely well until a smooth frosting has formed. This will take a few minutes so don’t get impatient with it and add milk. The consistency of the frosting should be that of toothpaste. It should be thick enough to have to use some pressure to push it out of a piping bag and should not be thin enough to spill out.
Equally divide the icing into 3 bowls.
Add a little bit of red food coloring to one bowl and green food coloring to another bowl. Whisk together well to fully and evenly color all of the icing.
Once the icing is colored, spoon into 3 separate piping bags. Tip – You can use plastic baggies however they are more fragile and more prone to bursting or rupturing with squeezing pressure so use at your own risk.
Snip a small hole in the bottom of each piping bag. Tip – The larger the hole you snip into the bag, the more icing will come out. When the hole is large and the icing comes out very thick, it makes it harder to be precise. So start with a small snip before cutting it larger. To make it easier for decorating, place each of the bags of frosting upright into 3 separate cups. Doing this will keep the frosting in the bags and not drizzle or leak out.
To ice, hold the piping bag at a slightly tilted angle about ⅛” away from the cookie. Gently squeeze the piping bag to pipe the frosting in whatever design you so desire. See Notes Below for 6 Decorating Ideas.
Gingerbread cookies keep amazing well airtight at room temp for up to one month. If you don’t seal them in an airtight container or ziptop bag, they could actually become too soft to the point of getting soggy. Just seal them well and you will be fine.

If you want some or all of your cookies to be double-dipped (white chocolate on one side/half), melt the Ghirardelli White Chocolate Melting Wafers* (See Notes) in a separate medium, microwave-safe bowl.
Place a piece of wax paper under a wire rack, and using a fork, dip the Oreos in the melted milk chocolate, allow the excess to run off in between the tines of the fork, and gently place on the rack. If you plan to double dip in white chocolate, allow the milk to fully set before picking the cookie up with your fingers and dipping half in the melted which chocolate.
Add the sprinkles before the chocolate sets up.
Optionally, add red and/or green food coloring to melted white chocolate until desired color intensity and shade is reached, transfer to small plastic baggies, snip the corners, and carefully pipe/drizzle over the cookies.
Allow the chocolate to set, about 1 hour at room temp. Tip – You can place the cookies in the fridge to set up but I find that the chocolate dulls a bit when they are flash-chilled this way and the final look of the cookies isn’t as shiny and glossy so I wait for it to set up at room temp.

Add the confectioners' sugar and cream them together (beat until incorporated and creamy), about 3 minutes.
Add the egg, vanilla, and beat until well incorporated. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and beat until just incorporated; don't overmix.
Make balls of 3 sizes - 1 teaspoon, 2 teaspoons, and 3 teaspoons, respectively. You should make approximately 20 balls of each size, so 60 balls total. This will vary slightly based on the exact size you make the balls.
For the large size (3 teaspoons of dough), bake for about 10 minutes. For the medium size (2 teaspoons of dough), bake for about 7 to 8 minutes. For the small size (1 teaspoon of dough), bake for about 5 to 6 minutes, or until done.* (See Notes) Cookies are done when they are set around the edges, even if they look a bit underdone in the centers because they firm up as they cool. Allow them to cool on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely. Tip - If possible, I recommend baking one sheet of cookies at a time, on the center rack, and rotating your baking sheet midway through for the most optimal results.
To the same large mixing bowl, add the butter, and beat on high speed until it's smooth and creamy, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Using a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop dough mounds and place them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, until no longer glossy on top and they are puffed and set. Tip – If possible, bake cookies one sheet at a time, on the middle oven rack, rotating your pans one time midway through baking.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
After the cookies have cooled completely, make the icing. Do not ice the cookies before they are fully cooled (about 30 minutes, depending on the temp of your kitchen) because the icing will melt and you’ll have a mess.
To a medium bowl, add the confectioners’ sugar (sift it if it’s particularly lumpy), milk, vanilla, and whisk to combine and until smooth.
Dip the tops of the cookies in the icing and place them back on the wire rack. Allow cookies to set for about 15 minutes so the icing can set.
I don’t mind storing iced, glazed, or frosted baked goods airtight at room temp for a few days if said icing contains milk or butter as the sugar acts as a preservative. However, store them how you are most comfortable including the fridge for up to 1 week. Note that cookies stored in the fridge will tend to dry out quicker.

Using a medium cookie scoop, form approximately 21 equal-sized mounds of dough by compressing, compacting, and squeezing until the dough comes together; don’t be afraid to really squeeze it. (See Notes 1 and 2 below)
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, flatten slightly (when properly chilled, cookies don’t flatten much while baking so flatten them now), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Alternatively, chill in the freezer for about 1 hour. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Make sure the cookies are in the exact shape you want them before chilling, because it’s exceedingly difficult to re-shape them after chilling – they will just fall apart. Before chilling, if desired, add a few additional chips to the top of each mound of dough.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake.

Keep doing this until all the flour mixture is added, once it is all fully mixed in, that’s it, do not overmix or your teacakes will be tougher.
Line a large baking sheet with a Silpat liner or parchment paper. Make 2-tablespoon sized dollops of the cookie dough balls, and place them on the baking sheet, spaced about 1 inch apart (we are not baking at this point, so it’s okay to place them this close together).
Once you have all your dough balls made, place the sheet tray into the fridge for at least 1 hour, up to overnight if you have time. The longer the dough chills, the more evenly the cookies will bake later. You cannot skip chilling the dough or your teacakes will spread.
While the dough is chilling or before you want to bake, preheat the oven to 350F. Get another sheet baking sheet out and line it with a Silpat or parchment paper.
Take the cookie dough balls and using your hands, roll them into evenly formed balls. Place these dough balls on the sheet tray about 2 inches apar.
Bake for 15-18 minutes until they are puffed up, lightly golden brown on top, and the outer edges where they meet the sheet tray are slightly darker golden brown; don’t overbake.
Allow them to cool for about 3 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. They MUST cool all the way before adding the glaze or the glaze will melt off.
While cookies cool, make the glaze.
Add the confectioners’ sugar*, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 4 tablespoons of the eggnog to a medium-sized bowl. Whisk this mixture together until completely smooth. It should be thick but pourable. If it is not pourable, add another tablespoon of eggnog and whisk it in.
Using a spoon, drizzle the glaze on top of the cookies, adding about 1 teaspoon of glaze per cookie. Repeat until all the cookies are glazed.
Optionally add Christmas or holiday-themed sprinkles as desired. Alternative decorations can be a sprinkle of more cinnamon or nutmeg on top, or leave them as is- still delicious!",15,"▢ 1 cup unsalted butter, softened (2 sticks)",▢ 1 cup granulated sugar,▢ 2 large eggs,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 3 cups all-purpose flour,▢ 2 teaspoons baking powder,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/eggnog-teacakes/,▢ ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon,▢ ½ teaspoon salt,▢ ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg,▢ 2 cups confectioners’ sugar,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon,▢ ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg,▢ 4 to 5 tablespoons eggnog,"▢ Christmas sprinkles for decorating, optional and to taste",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To a large bowl with handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream (a verb that means to mix; there is no cream in this recipe) together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add the egg and vanilla and beat just until combined, about 30 seconds.
Add in the dry ingredients while mixing on low speed just until combined, about 30 seconds. Do not overmix or your cookies may turn out crispy rather than soft.
Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a 6-inch round disc, wrap each disc with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour, and up to 1 day (meaning you can make this dough ahead of time and keep in the fridge for up to 1 day).
When ready to bake, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place one disc unwrapped on a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll into an 1/8-inch thick sheet of dough, and use cookie cutters (I recommend 3 to 4-inch stand cutters) to cut out your shapes. Repeat until dough is used up from both dough discs. Note: If the dough chilled for more than 2 hours, you’ll likely need to let it rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before rolling.
Place the cut out cookies on a parchment or Silpat-lined baking sheet and place in the refrigerator to chill for an additional 15 minutes.
While the cookies are chilling, preheat the oven to 350F.
Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, just until the edges are turning light brown. You do not want the edges to be golden brown or you will end up with crispy cookies. Remember that cookies will continue to firm up as they cool and due to carryover cooking as they sit on the baking sheet, they will continue to take on a bit more color.
After about 5 to 10 minutes, or when cool enough to move them, transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow them to cool completely before frosting them.
Prepare the icing by adding the egg whites and the confectioners’ sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute, then increase to high speed and beat until glossy stiff peaks form, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Divide the icing and use gel food coloring to color as desired, fill your pastry bags, then use a #2 or #3 piping tip to pipe a border around the cookie and let it set for 5 minutes.
Add 1/4 teaspoon of water to the icing to thin it out slightly, then fill in the cookies. Use a toothpick to spread the icing out to cover fully.
Add sprinkles as desired before frosting hardens. Allow the cookies to fully set at room temperature before packaging up in an air-tight container.
Cookies should remain soft and fresh for about 10 days when stored in a cool place such as your countertop or pantry in the winter months, and kept in an airtight container.

Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping two-tablespoon mounds (I made 20). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter.
Important note – Strategically place candy corn so that it’s not baking directly on cookie sheet because it will melt, burn, or turn runny if it is. The candy corn pieces need to be in the interior of the cookies, shielded and buffered by dough.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if slightly undercooked, pale and glossy in the center.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the lemon zest, honey, optional food coloring, and beat on medium-high speed until well combined, about 2 minutes.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the flour, cornstarch, optional salt, and baking soda (keep the baking soda in a nice little mound rather than sprinkling it).
Add the lemon juice directly on top of the baking soda. It will bubble and foam, which means the baking soda has been activated and this is good; if your soda doesn’t bubble it’s old and expired. Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.

I swirl the pan in the last minute or so to make sure I can really see the color changes. Butter will go through stages of hissing, sputtering, and making noise until the water cooks off at which point the browning occurs. Butter will smell nutty and aromatic.
Pour browned butter, and scrape out any browned bits from the kettle, into the bowl of a stand mixer or to a large mixing bowl and allow it to cool for about 15 minutes.
Add the egg, sugars, and beat on medium-speed for about 3 minutes, or until creamed (a baking term, you're not adding any cream) and slightly fluffed and smooth. Note - batter will not fluff and cream like batter that uses room temperature butter because this butter was melted; this is normal.
Add the vanilla and beat to incorporate.
Add the coconut and beat to incorporate.
Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and beat to incorporate; don't overmix.
Add 1 cup chocolate chips and beat to incorporate.
Using a medium cookie scoop, divide the dough into 16 equal-sized portions. Tip - My advice is not to try to make bigger or smaller cookies or alter the yield of exactly 16 cookies because coconut burns easily and there is a reason why we are making 16 cookies here.
Place dough mounds on a large plate, cover with plasticwrap, and place in the freezer for 1 hour. Don't ask if you can place the whole mixing bowl in the freezer; you cannot. You need to portion the dough out onto a plate, then freeze. You could alternatively chill for 3 to 4 hours in the fridge.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a light-colored baking sheet with a Silpat liner, place 8 mounds of dough on it, evenly spaced and ever-so-slightly flattened between the palms of your hands.
Bake for about 13 minutes, or until your cookies are done. Very Important - Ovens, pans, climates, ingredients, etc. will cause cookies to bake at different rates so my baking guideline for my oven was 13 minutes, but yours may be different. Because coconut burns easily, as does white chocolate, keep a very close eye on your cookies and go by the cookies, not the clock. When they are done, the tops will barely look like they are set and will be pale and loose-looking, but they do firm up upon cooling. The undersides of the cookies, from what you can see when you are looking at them in the oven, without touching them, will be medium golden brown at the base when they are done. I also recommend rotating your baking sheet once midway through baking. I also recommend baking one sheet at a time (8 and then the other 8).
Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, or until they are firm enough to move before serving.
Tip - Immediately upon pulling cookies from the oven, add 3 to 4 white chocolate chips to the top of each cookie for visual appeal. The reason you do this after baking is because white chocolate is prone to scorching and they look better visually if added later.

Using a spoon (or pastry bag or ziptop bag with corner cut off if you want to be fancier but I didn’t bother), evenly drizzle the chocolate in long vertical lines, parallel to each other, spaced about 1/2-inch apart. Pie doesn’t have to be cooled to add the chocolate drizzle.

Homemade Thin Mints,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Apr 23, 2024",4.59,55,Cookies,15 minutes,NA,Cooling Time: 45 minutes minutes,Total Time: 1 hour hour,Servings: 18,6,"Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or wax paper; set aside. Clear out a spot in your refrigerator or freezer to accommodate baking sheet.
In a shallow microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and shortening (the shortening helps the chocolate stay smooth when using it for dipping; it prevents that thick and gloppy, chocolate getting hard before you want it to phenomenon) and heat for 1 minute on high power to melt. Stir and heat in 10- to 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred very smooth.
To the melted chocolate add 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract* and stir. If you prefer it mintier, add another 1/4 teaspoon. I used 3/4 teaspoon in total, but because all brands and taste preferences differ, taste your chocolate and add peppermint to taste.
Add 1 cracker to the chocolate, coat it, and remove it by lightly scooping it up from the underside with a fork, allowing excess chocolate to drain off through fork tines. Place cracker on parchment and repeat with all remaining crackers. If necessary, re-heat the chocolate in 10- to 15-second bursts if it starts getting too firm for smooth dipping.
After all crackers have been dipped, place baking sheet in refrigerator. Although these will solidify at room temperature, the shortening in the chocolate lengthens the amount of time that will take; the fridge or freezer helps speed it up.
Store extra Thin Mints in an airtight container in the refrigerator for many weeks. In the freezer, I estimate that these could be kept for 3 to 6 months successfully.",4,▢ 18 Ritz Crackers,"▢ 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted","▢ 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening, optional but recommended",▢ ¾ teaspoon peppermint extract*,NA,NA,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/homemade-thin-mints/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pour butter into a large mixing bowl, making sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan with a spatula and transfer any browned bits (they have wonderful flavor) from the bottom of pan into the mixing bowl. Wait momentarily before adding the egg so you don’t scramble it.
Add the egg, sugars, vanilla, and whisk to combine.
Add flour, cornstarch (keeps cookies soft) baking soda, salt, and stir to combine. Dough may seem crumbly yet oily, this is okay.
Add the mini chocolate chips and stir to combine.
Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 10 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and place one mound of dough in each cavity in muffin pan; it’s okay if it doesn’t touch the sides because it will spread in the oven.
Bake for about 11 to 13 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. Cookie cups firm up as they cool.
Using the bottom of a shot glass, lightly press down in the center of each cookie cup going about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch deep to create a well where the chocolate lava will be added later. Tip – If your shot glass is sticking to the cookie cups, spray it with cooking spray as necessary. Set pan aside while you make the chocolate lava.
Chocolate Lava – To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add the chocolate chips, butter, and heat on high power to melt, about 45 seconds. Heat in additional 15-second bursts as necessary until chocolate can be stirred smooth. (Note – The lava made this way sets up at room temp. If you prefer it to stay soft and melty make this chocolate ganache which is made with cream rather than butter.)
Using a small spoon, add about 1 rounded teaspoon of chocolate to each cookie cup. Depending on how deep you went with the shot glass, you may need to melt additional chocolate chips in order to fill each cup up completely.
Allow cookie cups to remain in pan for about 15 minutes before removing and serving. Cookie cups will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days.

Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula as necessary. Bake for about 20 to 24 minutes, or until top is set in center and done; don’t overbake. Blondies firm up as they cool. A toothpick should come out clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter.
Place pan on a wire rack to cool for at least 90 minutes before cutting and frosting.
Cut with heart-shaped cookie cutters or simply frost the entire pan if desired.
Frosting
To a large bowl (or to the bowl of a stand mixer) add the butter and beat until light and creamy.
Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and beat with an electric mixer (or use the paddle attachment of a stand mixer) to incorporate.
Add the cream slowly in the amount necessary to achieve desired frosting consistency.
Turn frosting out over cookies. Note – You may have a small amount of frosting left over if you don’t like an overly thick amount of frosting on your cookies. If you leave the 8×8 pan intact and don’t cut into cookies, it will be approximately the right amount. Extra frosting will keep airtight in the fridge for at least 2 weeks.

Remove pie from oven, evenly sprinkle with marshmallows, chocolate chips, and return pie to oven.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until marshmallows are puffed, slightly melted, and as very lightly toasted as desired. Watch very closely because all ovens and marshmallows vary and they can go from white to burnt in the span of 30 seconds. I stand in front of my oven, watch, and remove the pie at a seconds notice.
Allow pie to cool in dish for about 5 minutes, or until cool enough to serve, if you’re digging in with spoons. If you want to plate this dessert, allow pie to cool for about 30 minutes because the cookie firms up as it cools and it’s much easier to get clean slices.",10,"▢ ½ cup unsalted butter, 1 stick, melted","▢ ⅓ heaping cup peanut butter, I use Jif, Skippy or similar; natural PB can separate and/or be too oily",▢ 1 large egg,"▢ 1 cup light brown sugar, packed",▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract,▢ ¾ cup all-purpose flour,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/peanut-butter-smores-cookie-pie/,▢ ½ cup graham cracker crumbs,"▢ ¼ teaspoon salt, optional and to taste",▢ 2 cups mini marshmallows,▢ ¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop or your hands, form approximately 15 equal-sized mounds of dough and place one mound of dough into each cavity of the muffin pan.

Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the milk, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed to incorporate, about 1 minute. (Mine didn’t incorporate fully, but it was mixed in. It’ll fully incorporate after adding the flour.) Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Add the flour, salt, and beat on medium-low speed until just incorporated, about 1 minute. If your dough is overly dry, crumbly, and not coming together, add a tiny splash of milk as needed until the dough comes together and is smooth.
Optionally, add red food coloring to tint the dough as pink as desired and mix well to incorporate. All food coloring types and brands vary, as do preferences, so add accordingly. Beat well after each drop or two since you can’t un-do it and sometimes the color intensity will sneak up on you.
Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop or your hands, form approximately 10 equal-sized mounds of dough.
Use your thumb to make a shallow well, like you’re making thumbprint cookies, and insert one cherry into each mound of dough. Carefully seal and crimp the edges around the cherry and flatten mounds slightly, taking care not flatten too much and squish the cherry.
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.

It’s a bit tricky with pink cookies to tell if they’re done, but I err on the side of underbaking so they stay softer over time.
Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet completely. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don’t use a rack.

Tip – Strategically place a few chocolate chips on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top. I also supplemented the chocolate chips by adding a few extra from the bag of chips (you won’t need the entire bag for dipping).
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading and this dough is already prone to spreading.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (do not bake more than 6 cookies per sheet because these cookies spread) and bake for about 13 to 14 minutes (if your cookies are smaller, bake less; and keep a watchful eye on them since ovens very dramatically), or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 20 minutes before dipping them. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don’t use a rack.
To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add about 1 cup chocolate chips and heat on high power to melt, about 1 minute. Stop to check and stir and heat in 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth.
Either dip one cookie halfway into the melted chocolate or hold cookie over chocolate bowl and spoon chocolate on, allowing the excess to drip off; I prefer the later method. Repeat dipping process with all cookies, heating additional chocolate as necessary. Transfer dipped cookies to a parchment paper-lined baking tray.
Before chocolate beings to set up, add the sprinkles, sanding sugar, or your favorite decorating items (chopped candy, nuts, etc.). Allow chocolate to set up for at least 2 hours, or until fully set (duration will depend on how thick the chocolate coating is and air temperature. Although you could speed this up by placing cookies in fridge or freezer, I waited it out at room temp. Cookies will keep airtight at cool room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

Place pie crust on a lightly floured surface and using a pizza wheel, slice into approximately 16 sections, about 2-inch squares. Because the crust is likely a circle, if you make 4 rows of 4, a couple sections may be a bit skimpy so take crust from two skimpy sections and smoosh it together to make a section big enough to contain a Kiss. This is not an exact science, it’s okay if not all sections are exactly the same size.
Place one chocolate kiss in the center of each section.
Using your fingertips, seal the dough at the top to fully contain the kiss. Pat smooth with your palms and flatten slightly into a mound. Place mound on prepared baking sheet; repeat with remaining crust sections and kisses until gone.
Bake for about 15 to 17 minutes, or until crust is just set and done; puffs firm up as they cool. The tops will appear fairly pale while the undersides will be more golden; don’t overbake or the undersides could burn.

Stir in 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips; reserve remainder to place on cookie tops before baking.
Distribute dough equally among the 12 muffin pan cavities; each will approximately be filled to about three-quarters full. The cookies don’t rise much (nothing like muffins) so it’s okay if dough seems high in the cavities.
Evenly divide remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips by placing a few chips on each cookie top, which creates a nice visual appeal.
Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, or until tops have set and are pale golden. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Depending on your climate, muffin pan, brand of ingredients, taste preferences, etc. baking times will vary. Watch your cookies and not the clock; bake until done. Allow cookies to cool in pan for at least 15 minutes before removing them.

Remove Skippy Natural Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Spread from freezer and using a 1-teaspoon measure, scoop out rounded teaspoons, and place one teaspoon of chocolate on top of each mound of dough.
Gently push the chocolate peanut butter down into the dough mound, and use your fingers to carefully stretch up the sides of the dough to fully encase the Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter. Make sure it’s fully encased so it doesn’t leak while baking. Repeat for all 12 mounds.
Place one mound in each of the cavities of the prepared pan.Bake for about 14 to 16 minutes (I baked for 14 1/2), or until tops are just set; making sure not to overbake because cookies will continue to cook in pan (carryover cooking) while they cool. Allow cookies to cool in pan for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until firm enough to remove.
To dislodge cookies if you’re having any trouble, gently run the tip of rubber spatula or plastic knife around the rim of the cavity; a sharp knife will scratch your pan. Or, invert the pan and tap the bottom and they’ll pop out. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Unbaked cookie dough mounds can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Vanilla Melting Moments Cookies with Nutella-Cream Cheese Filling,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 08, 2024",4.50,4,NA,15 minutes,9 minutes,Chill Time: 3 hours hours,Total Time: 3 hours hours 24 minutes minutes,Servings: 12,10,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large bowl and electric hand mixer), beat the butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the remaining cookie ingredients. Mix on low speed until incorporated, about 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will progress from very crumbly and sandy, to soft and combined. After dough has combined; don’t overmix. Dough will be soft, and on the sticky and tacky side.
Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form 2-tablespoon mounds (I made 12). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten slightly with the tines of fork to create a criss-cross pattern (or use your palm or a flat drinking glass bottom if you don’t want a pattern). Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter (there are no leaveners or eggs to help them stay thicker; you’re relying on chilled dough).
Preheat oven to 350F, line baking sheets with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet).
Bake for about 9 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if slightly undercooked, pale and glossy in the center. They should not be ‘browned’ and should stay a pale white/cream shade. Do not overbake because cookies will firm up as they cool.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooking.
Nutella-Cream Cheese Filling: 
To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large bowl and electric hand mixer), combine first four ingredients (through vanilla), and beat on medium-high speed to incorporate.
With the mixer running, slowly add the cream 1 tablespoon at a time, until filling combines and desired consistency is achieved. Note that Nutella seems to vary and some jars are dry and some are very runny; this significantly effects how much cream to add.
Spread a generous 2+ tablespoons of filling on 6 cooled cookies, and match them up with the 6 unfrosted halves, and join together to create sandwiches.",10,"▢ ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened (1 1/2 sticks; margarine may be substituted",▢ 1 cup all-purpose flour,▢ ½ cup cornstarch,▢ ½ cup confectioners’ sugar,▢ 1 tablespoon vanilla extract,▢ ¾ cup Nutella,Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/vanilla-melting-moments-sandwich-cookies-with-nutella-cream-cheese-filling/,"▢ ¼ cup cream cheese, softened (light cream cheese is okay)",▢ ½ cup confectioners’ sugar,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"▢ about 3 tablespoons cream or milk or as needed, adjust to desired filling consistency",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the water and heat on high power to boil, about 1 minute.
Slowly and very carefully add the baking soda to the water. Use caution because it will bubble up vigorously. Stir to dissolve the baking soda.
Pour water-baking soda mixture over dough and stir to combine. Dough will look like streusel topping. Fluffy and loose, but when squeezed together, compacts to form a dough.
Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping two tablespoon mounds (I made 15). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds about halfway with your palm, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter, and these cookies are already prone to spreading and baking flat.

Caramel-Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookie Cups,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Jul 15, 2025",5,1,NA,10 minutes,10 minutes,Additional Time: 10 minutes minutes,Total Time: 30 minutes minutes,12 hearty stuffed cookies,9,"Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a Non-Stick 12-Cup Regular Muffin Pan extremely well with cooking spray; set aside. I don’t like the cosmetic look of paper liners because of ridges they leave, and have never tested this recipe with them and unsure if they stick.
To a large microwave-safe mixing bowl, add the butter and heat to melt, about 1 minute on high power. Allow the butter to cool momentarily so you don’t scramble the egg.
Add the egg, sugars, vanilla, and whisk to combine.
Add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, optional salt, and stir until just combined; don’t overmix
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Using a 1/4-cup measure, portion out the dough, into 12 equal-sized pieces. I found that a scant 1/4 cup was an ideal size and allowed for 12 cookies. If you use a slightly slightly overfilled 1/4-cup, you may only yield 10-11 cookies. The chocolate chips may be prone to falling out, but just keep pressing them back in, and strategically place chips at the top of the dough mounds.
To the center of each dough mound, insert 1 caramel. Tuck the sides up the dough up around the caramel so that it’s totally contained and sealed within dough. This is important so it doesn’t touch the sides of the pan while baking since they could turn into sticky, molten mess. Roll each stuffed mound of dough between palms to form smooth balls and place 1 ball into each of the 12 cavities of the prepared pan.
Bake for about 10 to 11 minutes, or until tops are just set; making sure not to overbake because cookies will continue to cook in pan (carryover cooking) while they cool. Allow cookies to cool in pan for 15 to 20 minutes, or until firm enough to remove. I baked the cookies shown for 10 1/2 minutes and allowed them to cool in pan for 20 minutes. To dislodge cookies if you’re having any trouble, gently run the tip of rubber spatula around the rim of the cavity. Don’t use a knife because it’ll scratch the pan. Or simply invert the pan over a your work surface and tap on the bottom and they’ll pop out. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Unbaked cookie dough mounds can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat or spray with cooking spray; set aside.
Smoosh a cream cheese dough ball and a chocolate dough ball together, making sure they’re tightly combined. Depending on how chilled your dough is, you may really need to squeeze firmly. Be careful that any chocolate dough that rubs off onto your palm doesn’t stain the vanilla dough. Wipe your hands frequently and as necessary. Repeat, combining the doughs, until all dough is gone. You’ll likely have about 1 dozen un-matched Cream Cheese Cookie dough balls leftover because that recipe makes a bigger batch. When you’re ready to bake the unmatched Cream Cheese Cookies, bake for 8 to 9 minutes. Unbaked dough can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 4 months.
Place black-and-white mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart. I recommend baking 6 to 8 cookies per sheet, no more. Flatten slightly before baking.
Bake for about 12 to 13 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set. Don’t overbake because the chocolate cookie portion is prone to drying out and getting crumbly if overbaked. Cookies may look loose and unset on baking tray, but they firm up as they cool. (The cookies shown in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled in the freezer for 2 months, allowed to stand at room temp for 15 minutes, and were baked for 12 minutes, with trays rotated halfway through). If your cookies stayed domed while baking, tap them gently with the back of a spoon to flatten.

Milky Way Chocolate Cookie Crumble Bars,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Oct 02, 2024",5,2,Bars & Blondies,10 minutes,28 minutes,NA,Total Time: 38 minutes minutes,12 servings,7,"Preheat oven to 350F. Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside.
In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute. Allow the butter to cool momentarily so you don’t scramble the egg. Add the egg, sugars, coffee (water may be substituted but coffee is highly recommended to bring out the chocolate flavor; the bars do not taste like coffee at all), vanilla, and stir or whisk vigorously to combine, about 1 minute.
Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, optional salt and stir until just incorporated. Dough will be quite thick and dense.
Reserve about 2/3 cup dough; set aside. Turn remaining dough out into prepared pan, smoothing it lightly with a spatula. Evenly sprinkle the Milky Ways over the dough. Using your fingers, lightly crumble the reserved cookie dough over the top in irregular, marble-sized chunks. Pour sweetened condensed milk over the top (just eyeball slightly over half of the can as you pour slowly).
Bake for about 27 to 30 minutes, or until center is mostly set. The sweetened condensed milk should nearly be set in all places, but possibly a little loose in the very center of the pan is okay. Edges will be firm, raised, and darker than the interior. Bars firm up more in pan as they cool; don’t overbake because you want these to stay soft and gooey, and cocoa powder is prone to turning dry.
Allow bars to cool in pan for at least 3 hours before slicing and serving (use foil overhang to lift out). I recommend cooling for 1 hour on the counter, and at least 2 hours in the refrigerator, or overnight. This ensures clean, pretty cut marks. If you don’t care about that, bars may be consumed as soon as they are cool enough to eat; grab a spoon and dig in. Extra bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
Bars may be kept gluten-free by replacing the flour with your favorite gluten-free baking blend.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the egg, vanilla, and beat until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the oats, both flours, baking soda, optional salt, and beat just until incorporated, about 1 minute. Fold in the raisins and chocolate chips by hand, or beat just momentarily to incorporate.
Turn dough out onto a large piece of plasticwrap and form a large log with it, about 12 to 14 inches in length and about 3 inches in diameter. Seal up the bundle, roll it back and forth a couple times to smooth it out so one side isn't flat from resting on the counter, and place it in the freezer to chill for at least 2 hours, up to 2 months. Tip - Vertically slice a cardboard paper towel roll and place dough inside the tube to help to prevent it from flattening or getting lopsided in the freezer until it's set.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat, parchment, or spray with cooking spray; set aside. Allow log to come to room temperature for about 5 minutes to make slicing easier, or microwave it for 10 to 15 seconds. With a very sharp knife, slice log into 14 to 15 slices. Each slice should be 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Do not make your slices thinner because cookies will spread and you won't get the chewy edges and soft centers that make these cookies so wonderful.
Place slices on prepared baking tray, spaced 2 inches apart, and bake no more than 8 cookies per tray because they spread a bit more than the average cookie. Bake for about 15 minutes (this sounds long but remember dough was frozen and is 1-inch thick), or until edges are set and centers are just beginning to set. It's okay if tops appear glossy and a bit under-done because cookies firm up as they cool. Rotate trays midway through baking. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 to 10 minutes before moving to racks to finish cooling. Cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week; however, consider baking only as many slices from the log as needed at any one time because fresh is always best. Unused portion of frozen log can kept in freezer for 2 to 3 months.

Buttery Vanilla Sandwich Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Jul 15, 2025",4.56,38,Cookies,30 minutes,8 minutes,NA,Total Time: 38 minutes minutes,Servings: 26,14,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or mixing bowl and hand mixer), add the butter and beat to soften and fluff it, about 1 minute.
Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar, vanilla, and beat to cream ingredients until fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
Add the flour and mix to incorporate it. The dough will be very sandy, pebbly, and dry. Add two tablespoons of half-and-half or cream and mix. The dough will come together and it will be on the soft and sticky side. If your dough is sandy and dry and hasn’t come together, add 1 additional tablespoon of cream, or as needed, so it combines. I used 2 tablespoons and cannot foresee needing more than 3 tablespoons of cream, but add cream very, very slowly until it combines.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for at least two hours, or up to five days, before rolling it out.
Turn the dough out onto a floured Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat or floured countertop and cover it with a piece of plasticwrap to prevent it from sticking to the rolling pin. Roll dough out to about one-eighth inch thick.
Using a 2-inch cookie cutter or biscuit cutter, cut out the dough into rounds (or if desired, cut them smaller in the one-inch range. Use a shotglass if you don’t have a one-inch cutter). Re-roll your scraps and use every last bit of dough until it’s gone. I made 26 rounds to yield 13 sandwiches.
Place rounds on a Silpat-lined, parchment-lined, or cooking sprayed baking sheet. I fit them all on one sheet. If dough has gotten soft while rolling and cutting it out, cover and refrigerate the tray for about an hour, which will help prevent spreading.
Preheat oven to 350F. Before baking, place about 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a shallow bowl and dredge each dough round through the sugar and return sugared rounds to baking sheet. Piece each round three or four times with the tines of a fork to give steam a place to escape so the cookies bake flat and don’t puff up while baking.
Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or just until they’ve set, rotating trays halfway through baking. I baked for 8 minutes. They’ll look glossy and shiny even when they’re done. Don’t let them turn brown in the least, and pull them even if they look underdone because they firm up as they cool. Don’t leave the kitchen and watch them like a hawk because they’re small, full of butter, white flour, sugar, and are highly prone to burning.
Allow cookies to cool for about 5 minutes on baking trays before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
While the cookies cool, make the buttercream. Beat one stick of butter to soften and fluff it, about 1 minute.
Add 1 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar (I don’t bother sifting), vanilla, and beat until soft and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Play with the sugar ratio depending on how thick you like your buttercream. I find 2 cups sugar gives me a frosting that’s just right for a job like this when I want a firmer frosting, but if you like looser frosting, 1 1/2 cups will probably do the trick.
Add food coloring very slowly, in the color of your choice, and mix to incorporate.
Frost one cookie generously with 1 to 2 tablespoons frosting, top with another cookie, sandwich them together, and lightly squeeze. Repeat until all cookies have been sandwiched.

Stop to stir. Heat in 10-second bursts until mixture can be stirred smooth; set aside to cool briefly.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or use an electric mixer), add the eggs, sugar, vanilla and beat for 5 to 8 minutes on medium speed, or until pale and creamy. (Original recipe recommends beating for 15 minutes, but I saw no changes in the mixture after about 5 minutes and believe 8 minutes is ample).
Add the flour, baking powder, melted chocolate-butter mixture, and remaining 5 ounces chopped chocolate and mix to combine, about 1 minute on medium-low speed (the machine will make lots of noise and shake from the chopped chocolate).
Remove the paddle, cover bowl with plasticwrap, and allow to stand at room temperature for about 1 hour in order for batter to firm up (Original recipe suggests 10 minutes but my batter was like chocolate sauce and it needed 1 hour).
Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop, scoop out mounds of dough onto Silpat-lined baking trays, placing 8 mounds per tray. Do not crowd them in case your cookies spread a fair amount (mine didn’t but I can foresee it). Allow mounds to remain on trays, uncovered, for about 1 hour before baking to help batter set up more.

Soft and Puffy Peanut Butter Coconut Oil Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Feb 08, 2024",4.80,5,NA,10 minutes,8 minutes,NA,Total Time: 18 minutes minutes,Servings: 18,6,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine peanut butter, coconut oil, egg, sugar and beat on medium-high speed to cream until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Note - Coconut oil should be the consistency of soft butter like you'd use to cream with sugar and eggs in traditional cookies. If coconut oil is rock hard, microwave it in a small bowl for 5 to 10 seconds or just until it begins to soften. If coconut oil is runny or melted, place it in the freezer momentarily until it firms up. A tiny amount of runniness is fine; it's an oil and that happens. But do not use melted or purely liquid coconut oil because you can't effectively cream a liquid; it would be like trying to cream liquid butter.
Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the vanilla and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup flour, corn starch, baking soda, optional salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. If your dough seems quite wet, sloppy, or isn’t combining, add up to another one-quarter cup flour, one tablespoon at a time, for a total of 1 1/4 cups. The dough shouldn’t be sticky or tacky, and a little loose and oily is preferred to dry and crumbly. It should have a Play-Doh like consistency, and if pinched and squished, it’ll stick together and to itself, but not to your hands. Over-flouring the dough will cause the cookies to be prone to cakiness and dryness.
Using a medium cookie scoop, form mounds that are 2 heaping tablespoons in size; or divide dough into approximately 18 equal-sized pieces. Place dough mounds on a large plate, and slightly flatten each mound. Get the dough mounds in the exact shape you want to bake them in because after chilling, flattening or re-shaping the dough is difficult. Cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours; up to 5 days. Do not bake these cookies with dough that has not been properly chilled because they will spread.
Preheat oven to 350°F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat, parchment, or spray with cooking spray. Place dough on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart; I bake a maximum of 8 per sheet. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, or until tops have just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. They firm up as they cool and I recommend the lower end of the baking range. The cookies in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled for 2 days, left at room temp for 30 minutes to warm up slightly, then baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated once at the 4-minute mark.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before moving. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Add the cocoa powder (I don't bother to sift), baking soda, and beat to incorporate, 1 to 2 minutes. Dough may be a bit crumbly in pieces, but pieces should all stick together forming a large mound when pinched, squeezed, and pushed together.

Using a 2-inch medium cookie scoop (about 2 heaping tablespoons of dough or 1.80 ounces by weight), form dough mounds or roll dough into balls. Recipe makes 13 cookies; dividing dough into 13 equal portions is another way to do this. Place dough on a large plate and flatten each mound with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern on top. Slightly flattening the mounds before baking ensures they don't stay too domed and puffed while baking because this dough, when properly chilled, doesn't spread much; just don't over-flatten.

Thick and Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Jul 15, 2025",4.48,46,NA,10 minutes,10 minutes,NA,Total Time: 20 minutes minutes,Servings: 18,4,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the butter, egg, brown sugar, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed to cream ingredients until very light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the oats, cinnamon (I use 1 tablespoon), baking soda, optional salt, and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Add the flour and beat to just incorporate, about 30 seconds. Note regarding flour - the secret to these cookies staying thick and chewy is the bread flour; although all-purpose may be substituted, the results will be superior with bread flour. Add the raisins and beat momentarily to incorporate. Transfer mixture to an airtight container or cover mixing bowl with plasticwrap and refrigerate dough for at least two hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake these cookies with dough that has not been properly chilled because they will spread.
Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat, parchment, or spray with cooking spray; set aside. Using a medium-sized two-inch cookie scoop form dough mounds, which is approximately two heaping tablespoons, or 1.50 to 1.60 ounces by weight. Place dough on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (maximum of 8 per sheet). Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges are set and tops have just set, even if slightly undercooked in the center, as cookies will firm up as they cool. It's a little tricky to judge doneness because of all the oats, but I suggest the lower end of the baking range and baking for 10 minutes for soft and chewy cookies. For crunchier cookies, extend baking time by 1 to 2 minutes, but take care not to overbake or they will be hard.
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Coconut Oil White Chocolate Cookies,Averie Sunshine,"Updated: Jul 15, 2025",5,3,NA,10 minutes,10 minutes,NA,Total Time: 20 minutes minutes,Servings: 15,6,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine coconut oil, egg, sugars, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed to cream until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Note - Coconut oil should be the consistency of soft butter like you'd use to cream with sugar and eggs in tradtional cookies. If coconut oil is rock hard, microwave it in a small bowl for 5 to 10 seconds or just until it begins to soften. If coconut oil is runny or melted, place it in the freezer momentarily until it firms up. A tiny amount of runniness is fine; it's an oil and that happens. But do not use melted or purely liquid coconut oil because you can't effectively cream a liquid; it would be like trying to cream liquid butter.
Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flours, baking soda, salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Solely using all-purpose flour will work, but the cookies will not be as chewy, may not rise as well, and may be more prone to spreading while baking. Bread flour creates chewier, puffier cookies that spread less.
Add the white chocolate, optional nuts (I didn't use any and if using the full cup, reduce the white chocolate somewhat so the dough can hold it all) and beat momentarily to incorporate or fold in by hand.
Using a 2-ounce or medium cookie scoop, form heaping mounds weighing 2 1/4-ounces each. This is a scant 1/4 cup of dough, or 3 heaping tablespoons; or divide dough into approximately 15 equal-sized pieces. They will look on the large side. Place dough mounds on a large plate, and slightly flatten each mound. Very important to get the dough mounds in the exact shape you want to bake them in because after chilling, flattening or re-shaping them is very difficult. Cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours; up to 5 days. Do not bake these cookies with dough that has not been properly chilled because they will spread.
Preheat oven to 350°F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mat,, parchment, or spray with cooking spray. Place dough on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart; I bake a maximum of 8 per sheet. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until tops have just set, even if slightly undercooked and glossy in the center. They firm up as they cool and I recommend the lower end of the baking range because they taste best when softer and paler. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before moving. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form two-tablespoon mounds. If chocolate is falling out of dough since there is an abundance, roll ball between palms to encourage it to stay in the dough.
Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter.

Add the flour, baking powder, salt and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add the sprinkles and beat momentarily to incorporate (the cookies can be made without sprinkles and baked as traditional plain sugar cookies if you prefer plain cookies or prefer to decorate them after baking). Transfer dough to airtight container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and up to 5 days, before baking.
Preheat oven to 350F, line baking sheets with a Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats, parchment, or spray with cooking spray; set aside. Using a 2-inch cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough or about 1.10 to 1.20 ounces by weight), form dough mounds and place on prepared baking sheet. Roll each mound into a smooth ball, and space balls about 2 inches apart on baking sheet (8 to 10 per tray). Use your hand to flatten the balls or for neater cookies, spray a flat-bottomed drinking glass with cooking spray and use it to flatten all balls to 3/4-inches in height, measuring about 2 inches in diameter. Re-spray with cooking spray as needed to prevent sticking. It's very tempting to over-flatten the balls, but don't because the cookies will spread like pancakes and become too flat and crispy while they bake. Err on the side of under- rather than over-flattening.
Bake for 9 minutes, until barely golden brown around the edges, even if slightly underbaked in the center; the tops will not be browned and should be pale. Watch them very closely after 7 minutes as sugar cookies burn easily and I recommend not cooking longer than ten minutes because cookies will darken, crisp, and firm up as they cool (The cookies shown in the photos were baked for 9 minutes and have chewy and slightly crisp edges with soft centers).

Add the cherries, white chocolate chips, and beat momentarily with the mixer until combined or fold in by hand; don't overmix or the cherries will break.
Notes regarding the flours - Solely using all-purpose flour will work, but the cookies will not be as chewy or rise as well because bread flour creates chewier results and gives greater rise. I live in a dry climate and only need 1 3/4 cups flour total but if you are in more humidity or your dough is very moist or loose, or are exclusively using all-purpose flour, adding up to 1/4 cup of additional flour, for 2 cups total, is possible. The more flour, the more the cookies will stay domed and puffed while baking and the less likely they will be to spread. If you're uncertain, err on the side of more, and if the cookies are too puffy after baking, you can tap them with the back of a spoon a couple times as they cool on the baking sheets to flatten them. Regardless of using bread or all-purpose, this is a fairly sticky and tacky dough because of the cherries.

The Oreos and their resulting crumbs help soak up some of the moisture from the batter and if not using them you may consider increasing the flour by 1 to 2 tablespoons as well as adding slightly more semi-sweet chocolate chips or truffles/candy based on how your batter looks). Chill dough for at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days before baking. Note that unbaked cookie dough can be formed into balls and stored in an airtight container or ziplock in the freezer for up to 3 months and baked straight from freezer to oven, extending baking time by a minute or two if necessary; this is nice so you don't have to bake all of them at once as they are rich.

I bake 8 to a tray, maximum.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the tops have just set, even though the centers will seem soft or slightly underbaked, as the cookies will set up quite dramatically as they cool.

If after flattening they seem very soft, return to the oven for 1 to 2 more minutes (mine were soft to the point of raw after flattening so I returned to the oven for 90 seconds; total baking time was 11 minutes). Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for at least 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

To the slightly cooled butter (so you don’t scramble the egg), add the egg, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, molasses, oil, vanilla, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt and whisk vigorously to combine until batter is smooth and silky.
Add the flour, baking, soda and stir to just incorporate; dough will be thick.
Fold in the chocolate chips and chocolate baking chunks (I used nearly 6 ounces; using a total of 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips is okay if you don’t have baking chocolate or a chocolate bar to chop).
Cover mixing bowl or transfer batter to an airtight food storage container and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days, prior to baking.

Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Coating: In a small bowl, combine about 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and stir to combine.
Using a cookie scoop, form 2-ounce mounds of dough and roll each ball through the cinnamon-sugar mixture and place on baking trays, spaced about 2 inches apart (I bake 8 to a tray).
Allow cookies to bake in fairly domed-up, mounded, ball-like shapes. Bake for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until tops have just set, taking care not to overbake so they stay soft and chewy. Note – The cookies in the photos are baked for exactly 8 minutes, and they’re soft with melted chocolate.
Upon removing trays from oven, if cookies stayed domed while baking (likely they will) immediately give cookies a firm yet gentle tap or two with the back of a spoon to flatten them. This creates a crackled top appearance and exposes some of the melted chocolate chips and chunks.

Using a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds (I did about 20 to 30 seconds). Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough (or place dough in an airtight container) and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours (I baked mine just shy of two days later, at 44 hours)
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat; set aside.
Scoop six 3 1/2-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. (I baked first batch of 6 cookies for 18 minutes, and baked second batch of 4 cookies for 16 1/2 minutes; I prefer the 16 1/2 minute cookies). Transfer baking mat or parchment paper to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.

In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power (you may microwave butter to a browned-butter state, which makes this cookie especially delicious, by cooking butter for about 3 to 4 minutes; watch it closely so it doesn't burn.
To the melted butter, add sugar, egg, vanilla, and whisk or stir vigorously to combine, for about 1 minute, slightly fluffing up the batter.
Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and stir until just incorporated. Add the oats and stir to combine.
Pour slightly less than three-quarters of the dough into the skillet, reserving about 1¼ cups (just eyeball it) to be crumbled on at the end; set skillet and large mixing bowl with reserved dough aside.
In a small bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter and stir until smooth. Pour mixture over the dough in the skillet.
Evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top.
Drop tablespoon-sized chunks of the reserved dough into the skillet, dispersing then as uniformly as possible over the surface, which forms the crumble topping.
Bake for about 25 minutes, or until edges begin to barely crisp up and most of the top surface of the cookie has set. The center may not be completely set; this is okay because cookie will continue to cook in the skillet after it's been pulled from the oven, noting that there is a fairly significant carryover cooking effect with cast iron; so don't overbake in the oven because cookie is meant to be very gooey.

Pour the cornflakes in a medium bowl and crush them with your hands to one-quarter of their original size. Add milk powder, sugar, salt, and toss to mix. Add butter and toss to coat; butter will act as the glue binding the dry ingredients to the cereal creating small clusters.
Spread the clusters on a parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes, at which point they should look toasted, smell buttery, and crunch gently when slightly cooled and chewed. Cool the cornflake crunch completely before storing or using in a recipe. Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, the crunch will keep fresh for 1 week; in the fridge or freezer, it wil keep for 1 month.
Combine the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl, add the egg and vanilla, and beat for 7 to 8 minutes.
Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute (do not walk away from mixer or overmix). Scrape down sides of bowl.
Still on low speed, paddle in the cornflake crunch and chocolate chips until just incorporated, no more than 30 to 45 seconds. Paddle in marshmallows until just incorporated.
Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop or a 1/3 cup measure, portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the dough domes flat. Wrap sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. Do not bake your cookies at room temperature – they will not hold their shape.
Heat oven to 375F. Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pans. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle, and spread, At the 18-minute mark, the cookies should be browned on the edges and just beginning to brown toward the enter. Leave them in the oven for an additional minute or so if they aren’t and still seem pale and doughy on the surface.

In a large mixing bowl combine the cake mix, softened butter, egg, vanilla and stir by hand or with a mixer until combined. Fold in the coconut flakes and chocolate chips. Place the mixing bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes. Do not skip this step. Chilled dough spreads less during the baking process and this dough must be chilled before baking.
Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop 1-inch domed balls on a Silpat-lined, parchment paper-lined, or cookie sheet that has been sprayed with cooking spray, allowing for adequate spacing. These cookies do spread some, but not terribly so. Before baking, insert a couple of the diced Mounds pieces into the top of each cookie, pressing in just past the surface. Bake at 350F for 8 to 10 minutes or until cookies have set up.
Tip: Because the cookies are dark chocolate, it is hard to tell if they are browning; instead look at the tops of the cookies. If the tops are shiny, they are still a bit raw and a matte appearance means they are more well-cooked (I baked for 8 1/2 minutes, retaining just a small portion of shininess in the centers of the cookies. I prefer slightly underbaked cookies and these were incredibly soft and moist).
The cookies may appear a bit loose on the tops after 10 minutes but they will continue to cook on the sheets after you remove the from the oven and will firm up as they cool. Do not overbake. Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets before attempting to move them.

In a mixing bowl combine the softened butter, egg, vanilla and stir by hand or with a mixer until combined. Add the cake mix and stir until smooth. If the dough seems too wet to be cookie dough, add a bit more cake mix, one tablespoon at a time, until it’s less wet. Conversely, if the dough seems dry and it’s not combining, add a tablespoon or two of water.
If time permits, I recommend chilling the dough by placing the mixing bowl in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Chilled dough spreads less during the baking process.
Form 1 inch balls on a Silpat-lined, parchment paper-lined, or cookie sheet that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Allow for adequate spacing because they do spread; which is why I recommend chilling the dough and do not exceed 1 rounded tablespoon-sized or 1 inch sized balls (I only placed 9 cookies on one cookie sheet and do not recommend trying to fit the batch on one cookie sheet). Bake at 350F for 8 to 10 minutes or until cookies are barely browned. They make look a bit loose and jiggly after only 8 to 10 minutes but they will continue to cook on the sheets after you remove the from the oven and will firm up as they cool. Do not overbake. Allow the cookies to cool well (on the cookie sheets is fine) before attempting to move them.
While the cookies are baking, make the frosting.
Frosting – In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer or whisk by hand. Add the vanilla extract and add two cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If you like thick(er) frosting, add more powdered sugar until desired consistency is reached. I used nearly 4 cups of powdered sugar in mine because I like very thick frosting (shown in the photos).
After the cookies have cooled, frost them (I applied a thick layer). Finish with sprinkles, sanding sugar, or other garnishes such as coconut flakes or chocolate shavings, as desired. Optionally, make sandwich cookies.
Because these cookies are frosted with cream cheese frosting, you may want store them in the refrigerator if they’re going to be out more than a day or so; use common sense.",8,"▢ ¼ cup unsalted butter, half of one stick, softened",▢ 1 large egg,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"▢ 1 cup + 1/8 cup strawberry cake mix (this is about 9 ounces, or half of an 18.25 ounce box of Pillsbury Strawberry Cake Mix","▢ ¼ cup unsalted butter, half of one stick, softened","▢ ¼ cup cream cheese, softened",Averie Cooks,https://www.averiecooks.com/strawberry-cake-mix-cookies-with-vanilla-cream-cheese-frosting/,▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,▢ 2 to 4 cups confectioners’ sugar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 13 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip – Strategically place a few chocolate chips on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top.
Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Dough is a bit on the oily side before chilling and becomes less oily as it chills.
