Chocolate Shortbread Christmas Cookies (with Free Printable Gift Labels),Chris Scheuer,5, 5 ,"Cookies, Dessert",American,Prep Time 45 minutes mins,Cook Time 30 minutes mins,Chill time 30 minutes mins,Total Time 1 hour hr 45 minutes mins,NA,27,"Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper and set aside.
Place the soft butter in a medium-large mixing bowl and stir for 10-15 seconds until nice and creamy. 1 cup very soft butter
Add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder and stir until well combined. The mixture may look dry at first - keep stirring and it will come together. ¾ cup powdered sugar, ⅓ cup cocoa powder
Stir in the vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and salt. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon peppermint extract, ½ teaspoon kosher salt
Add the flour and cornstarch and stir until no dry flour remains. If needed, use your hands to gently knead the dough in the bowl until smooth. 1¾ cups all-purpose flour, ¼ cup cornstarch
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a smooth disc.
Roll the dough to ¼-inch thickness (see tips above in the post about rolling). Cut into rounds using a 3-inch cookie cutter and place cookies 1½ inches apart on the prepared pans.
Gather scraps, reroll, and cut additional cookies.
Refrigerate the unbaked cookies for 30 minutes (longer is fine).
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
Bake cookies for 12-14 minutes, until set.
For a nice smooth cookie top, use a flat metal spatual to pat out any bumps or lumps.
Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
Line a work surface with a piece of parchment paper, large enough to fit all of the cookies.
Place the white chocolate candy melts and coconut oil (if using) in a small microwave-safe bowl.1 cup white chocolate candy melts, 1 teaspoon coconut oil
Microwave at 50% power in 15-second intervals, stirring between each, until smooth.
Have a second clean small bowl set out near the parchment paper.
Holding a cookie by the edge, dip the bottom of a cookie into the melted chocolate. Turn it a bit from side to side, to create a ""snowbank,"" then gently scrape excess chocolate on the extra bowl's rim.
Place cookies on parchment and immediately press a small pretzel piece into the chocolate for the tree trunk.
Allow the chocolate to set completely.
Optional: For more uniformly shaped Christmas trees, cut a small triangle from paper or light cardboard in the size you'd like your trees to be. Once the white chocolate ""snow"" has set, place the triangle in the center of a cookie where you want the tree. Using a small, sharp knife, lightly score along the edges of the triangle to outline the shape. Remove the template and pipe the buttercream just to cover the score lines.(See the video above for a quick demonstration.)
In a medium bowl, stir the butter until smooth.1 tablespoon soft butter
Add powdered sugar, 1½ tablespoons half-and-half, peppermint extract, and food coloring (if using). Stir until smooth, adding more half-and-half as needed for a thick but pipeable consistency. Add green food coloring, just a bit at a time until your desired tree color is reached. Stir well to combine. 1½-2 tablespoons half-and-half, ½ teaspoon peppermint extract, Green food coloring
Transfer buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip (Wilton #3 works well).
Pipe Christmas trees onto each cookie, starting at the top and widening as you pipe downward.
Immediately sprinkle with nonpareils and top with a decorative star or flower if desired. nonpareils and small decorative stars or flowers

Spray a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (or a round cake pan) with baking spray. If using a cake pan, line the bottom with a round of parchment. Set aside.
Place 8 Biscoff cookies in a zip-top bag and crush with a rolling pin or meat mallet until finely ground. Set aside.8 Biscoff cookies
In a medium-large bowl, stir together the soft butter and sugar until creamy (about 30 seconds). Add vanilla; stir again. Mix in the crushed Biscoff cookies. Add the cornstarch, salt and flour and stir until just combined and the dough begins to come together. 1 cup very soft butter, ½ cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, ¼ cup cornstarch, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, 1¾ cups all-purpose flour
Press dough evenly into the prepared pan. If the dough is sticky, lightly flour your fingertips.
Crush the remaining 4 Biscoff cookies in the same zip-top bag. Transfer crumbs to a small bowl, add melted butter, and microwave briefly (about 30 seconds). Stir with a fork until a crumbly mixture forms. Sprinkle evenly over the dough, press gently, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar. 4 Biscoff cookies, 1 tablespoon melted butter, 1 tablespoon cane or granulated sugar
Place the tart pan on a foil-lined baking sheet (to catch any butter drips) and bake on the center rack for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. Start checking early!
Turn off the oven. Remove from the oven and let the shortbread cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 15 minutes. Carefully remove from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with extra sugar and flaky sea salt, if desired. Cut into wedges while still slightly warm. flaky sea salt

Easter Bunny Shortbread Bites,Chris Scheuer,5, 9 ,"Dessert, Snack",American,Prep Time 45 minutes mins,Cook Time 40 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr 25 minutes mins,NA,20,"Heat oven to 325°F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang on 2 sides. Spray the foil and sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
Add the soft butter to a medium-large bowl. Stir for 20-30 seconds until smooth and fluffy. Add the sugar and extracts and stir until creamy and well combined.
Add the flour and salt. Stir with a sturdy spatula or wooden spoon until all of the flour is incorporated. The mixture will be crumbly. Use one hand to knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together.
Grab a handful of dough and crumble it into the pan. Repeat with remaining dough, creating a layer of large crumbs in the pan. Pat the dough into an even layer. I like to use a flat-bottom glass or a metal hamburger spatula to help pat and even out the dough.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes, then use the foil to lift the dough from the pan onto a cutting surface. Cut the dough into 1½-inch squares. I like to use a ruler to score the dough evenly before cutting with a long, sharp knife.
Place squares 1 inch apart on 2 ungreased cookie sheets; discard the foil.
Refrigerate the squares again for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325˚F.
Bake on the center rack for 15-20 minutes or until the bottoms of the bites are just beginning to brown.
Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. Repeat with the second pan of cookies. Proceed with the glazing right away or store in an airtight container until ready to glaze.
For each shortbread bite, cut one jelly bean in half, lengthwise, for the bunny ears.
For the faces, use an edible marker or a toothpick dipped in black (or a dark-hued) food color to make two little dots for eyes and one for the nose. Set aside to dry.
Combine all glaze ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whisk until nice and smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick but spoonable. If it seems too thin, add a little more powdered sugar. If it's too thick, add more half and half, a few drops at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. If too thin, add more powdered sugar. (See the picture above in the post.)
Transfer the icing to 2-3 shallow bowls (depending on how many colors you want to use). Add food color, one drop at a time, stirring well after each addition, until the desired color is reached.
Add 3-4 of the shortbread bites to one of the bowls and spoon the icing over each one to completely coat.
Using a fork, bring one of the shortbread bites up out of the icing and allow the excess icing to drip back into the bowl. When most of the extra icing has dripped off, wipe the bottom of the fork against the side of the bowl then transfer the cookie to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining shortbread bites and other colors of icing.
While the icing is still wet, place one M&M and two jelly bean halves on each shortbread to form the bunny face and ears.
Allow the shortbreads to completely dry on the rack. It will take 2-4 hours. When you touch them, the icing should feel hard and dry. When the icing is dry, flip the cookies over and let them sit until the bottoms are also nice and dry. If there's excess icing on the bottoms, you can remove it with a sharp knife.
Once the glaze has set, the shortbread bites can be stacked on a plate or platter or packed in bags or boxes to be given as gifts. If giving as a gift, I like to place the cookies in a plastic or cellophane bag and secure it with a twist tie to keep them fresh.
Store in an airtight container. These cookies can also be frozen. When ready to serve, remove them from the freezer and thaw in a single layer.",11,1 cup very soft butter,½ cup granulated sugar,½ teaspoon vanilla extract,¼ teaspoon almond extract,2 ½ cups all-purpose flour,¼ teaspoon kosher salt,"3 cups powdered sugar, maybe a bit more","6 tablespoons half & half, maybe a bit more",1 teaspoon vanilla extract,⅛ teaspoon almond extract,liquid food color,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Cafe Sucre Farine,https://thecafesucrefarine.com/easter-bunny-shortbread-bites-the-cutest-and-easiest-springtime-treat/,NA,NA,NA
Berries on the Wreath Shortbread Cookies,Chris Scheuer,5, 3 ,"Cookies, Dessert/Cookies",American,Prep Time 1 hour hr,Cook Time 30 minutes mins,Chilling Time 1 hour hr,Total Time 2 hours hrs 30 minutes mins,NA,23,"Pull out two sheet pans and set aside. Line each sheet with parchment paper.
Place soft butter in a medium-size mixing bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula until nice and smooth.
Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Mix together by hand for about 30 seconds until well blended.
Add the flour and cornstarch. Stir until dry ingredients are incorporated. The dough will be a little shaggy, but will start to come together.
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and gather into a ball. Knead 5-6 times until smooth and all the small pieces are worked in. If the dough seems sticky, knead it again with a tablespoon of extra flour on your work surface.
Divide the dough into two portions. Form each portion into a ball again and flatten it with your hand to form a flat disk. Turn the disks to coat both sides with flour. Set one portion aside.
Roll out the dough to an approximate ¼-inch thickness (see Café Tips above in the post). Move the dough several times as you’re rolling it out so there’s always a thin layer of flour beneath your dough. Also, keep your rolling pin, lightly dusted with flour.
With a scalloped, round cookie cutter, cut out circles of dough and transfer them to a sheet pan using a thin, metal spatula, leaving 2 inches between each cookie.
Use a mini round cookie cutter, a large pastry tip or any round hollow utensil that’s ½ -¾-inch in diameter (I use my apple corer tool) to cut out the center of each circle, forming a “wreath”.
Re-roll scraps as many times as needed to use up the dough. Repeat with the second portion of dough.
Place cutouts in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least one hour or up to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350˚F.
Remove the cutouts from the refrigerator and bake for 14-18 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Repeat with the second pan of cutouts. If the center opening has spread a bit in the oven, you can use the same small cutter and reinforce it right when the cookies come out of the oven and are still hot. If you wait to do this, the cookies will crack.
Cool completely on a wire rack before icing.
Combine powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons half-and-half, vanilla extract and almond extract (if using) in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick, but pourable. Add a little more half-and-half if too thick. Add more powdered sugar if it’s too thin. (See the picture above in the post.)
Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little larger than your cookies).
Hold onto the edges of a cookie and dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surface touches the glaze. Pull the cookie straight up out of the glaze and allow the excess glaze to drip into the bowl for about 15-20 seconds. (You can gently shake the cookie back and forth and up and down to get it to drip a little faster.) Then quickly flip the cookie to the right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Repeat with the remaining cookies. See pictures and a video in the post above, demonstrating this Dip, Drip and Flip technique.
Transfer each cookie to a wire rack after dipping. While the glaze is still wet, add the “berries” and “snow”. I like to dip 3 or 4 at a time then add the berries and snow before dipping more cookies.
Using a small spoon or your fingers, give each wreath, 3 sprinkles of red and pink nonpareils, forming clusters of berries. I like to use 1 larger red nonpareil and a sprinkle of the tiny red and pink nonpareils for each cluster but feel free to be creative here.
Add a small sprinkle of white nonpareils in between the berries, for the ""snow:
For a pretty look, add 1 small rosemary leaves to each cluster of berries, if desired.
Allow the icing to dry before serving.

Line a sheet pan or cookie pan with parchment paper. Set aside.
Add ⅓ cup cane (or regular granulated) sugar to a flat-bottomed bowl. This will be used for rolling the dough balls before baking. Set aside for now.
Whisk the egg whites vigorously in a medium lage bowl or 1 minute (don’t cheat!). The mixture will be very frothy and a pale, pale yellow.
Add the sugar and whisk for another minute (I set a timer). At this point, the mixture will be very smooth and creamy white (a little thicker than heavy cream).
Switch to a spatual now and add the baking powder and salt. Stir to combine. Add the vanilla and almond extracts along with the orange zest and chopped cranberries. Stir again.
Lastly, add the almond flour (spoon the flour into your measuring cup as you go, then level it with a flat-edged knife). Stir until the flour is incorporated.
Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then scoop into 10-12 equal-size scoops (I like to make mine around 35-40g each which is slightly over an ounce to an ounce and a half).
Scoop up a few portions at a time, and place them right into the prepared bowl of cane (or granulated) sugar. Turn each dough ball to coat with the sugar, then roll them into balls. Use a light hand while rolling.
Place the balls on the prepared sheet pan, spacing them about 2 inches apart to allow for a bit of expansion. If I’m not planning to dust the cookies with powdered sugar, after baking, I like to sprinkle each cookie with a bit more of the cane sugar.
Bake for 18-22 minutes. The cookies won’t take on much color but the bottoms should be a nice light golden brown.
Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
When completely cool, use a fine-mesh sieve or a powdered sugar duster to add a pretty layer of powdered sugar.

Strawberry Lemonade Melt Away Cookies,Chris Scheuer,5, 9 ,Cookies,American,Prep Time 20 minutes mins,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,"Place one of your oven racks in the upper third of the oven (this will keep the cookies from getting too brown on the bottom). Preheat oven to 325˚F. Line two sheet pans with parchment baking paper.
In a medium size bowl, whisk the butter until very light and fluffy, about 20-30 seconds. Add the powdered sugar fand stir until completely incorporated, then add the cornstarch, vanilla and salt. Stir until nice and smooth.
Lastly, add the flour. Stir until all of the flour has been incorporated. At first, the dough will be very crumbly. Keep stirring, turning the bowl and scraping the sides and bottom as you go.
The dough will be soft but you should be able to scoop it up and roll it into a ball. If it seems too soft to roll add 1 tablespoon of flour and stir until incorporated. This can be repeated one more time. If the dough still seems too soft to roll, put the bowl in the refrigerator for 15 minutes, then proceed as directed below.
Using a small cookie scoop, make equal-sized scoops of dough. Roll each scoop into a ball then roll each ball in the sugar. (The sugar will make it a little easier to roll the dough into nice round balls.) Roll the ball again to a nice round shape.
Arrange the dough balls on the prepared sheet pans, spacing them about 2 inches apart. With a flat bottom glass, gently flatten each cookie slightly, to about ½ inch in height.
Bake for 18-22 minutes or until just beginning to turn light golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a cooking rack.
While the cookies are baking, make the strawberry syrup by combining the strawberries and granulated sugar in a large microwave-safe bowl (at least 2-3 cup capacity as the strawberry mixture will bubble up a lot).
Place the bowl with the strawberries in the microwave and cook on high power for one minute.
Remove the strawberry mixture from the microwave and pour it into a fine-mesh sieve with a bowl set underneath. Stir and push on the solids in the strainer with a spatula or the back of a metal spoon until all of the juice has been strained out. Be sure to scrape the juice from the underside of the sieve. Discard the solids and transfer the syrup back to the original large microwave-safe bowl.
Return the syrup to the microwave and cook on high power for another minute. You should have right around 2- 2½ tablespoons of strawberry syrup. If there’s more, return the mixture to the microwave for 30-second increments until reduced to 2- 2 ½ tablespoons. Transfer the strawberry syrup to a medium-size bowl.
While the cookies are cooling, make the icing. Add the lemon juice to the bowl with the strawberry syrup. Stir well to combine.
Add powdered sugar and vanilla to the strawberry syrup in the bowl. Stir with a whisk until smooth and well combined. 
The mixture should be fairly thick but if you hold it above the bowl with your whisk or fork, it should be loose enough to drizzle in a thick ribbon. If it seems too thin, add an additional tablespoon of powdered sugar. If it’s too thick, add a teaspoon of extra lemon juice.
Spread icing on the cooled cookies.

Key Lime Cooler Cookies,Chris Scheuer,5, 4 ,"Cookies, Dessert",American,Prep Time 30 minutes mins,Cook Time 40 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr 10 minutes mins,NA,17,"Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a medium-large bowl, combine the butter, vanilla extract and lime zest. Stir until smooth and no lumps remain.
Add the sugar and sir until smooth and thoroughly combined.
Add the flour and cornstarch and stir until all flour is incorporated. It may seem like too much flour at first, but just keep mixing until it's incorporated. (Sometimes at the end, I use my hand and give the dough a couple of squeezes to bring the dough together.)
Scoop up the dough into 2 teaspoon-size portions. (if you like to weigh things, I made mine about a half ounce or 15g and get about 40 portions.) Roll each one in your hands and space at least an inch apart on the 2 prepared pans.
With a flat-bottomed glass dipped in sugar, press each cookie gently to flatten. I like to flatten mine to about 1 inch (25-30mm) in diameter - slightly larger than the size of a quarter coin.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until a light golden brown then remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
While the cookies are cooling, make the glaze.
Zest the two limes and transfer the zest to a cutting board. Finely chop the zest then transfer it to a small bowl or measuring cup.
Add the powdered sugar, lime juice and lime zest and stir with a fork or small whisk until smooth.
Place sheet pan or a piece of parchment under the cooling rack (there will be drips from the glaze) and flip each cookie over so that the bottoms are facing up on the cooling rack.
Brush each cookie bottom with the glaze. Allow the cookies to dry for 10 minutes then flip them back over and brush the tops generously with the glaze.
Allow the glaze to dry completely (30-60 minutes).
Combine the powdered sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir well to combine.
Using a small fine-mesh sieve or a powdered sugar duster, sprinkle a piece of parchment paper (large enough for all of the cookies) generously with the powdered sugar/cornstarch mixture. Place the cookies on the parchment and sprinkle the top of each cookie with a thick layer of powdered sugar.

Place the soft butter in a large bowl and stir until smooth and creamy Add the brown sugar and stir until any small lumps of butter and brown sugar are incorporated. Add the white sugar and stir again. The mixture will be a thick and sandy at this point.
Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla. Stir until creamy. Add the baking soda and salt and stir again.
Add the flour to the butter-sugar mixture and stir until incorporated. At first, it will seem like too much flour but just keep stirring (from the bottom up and scraping the sides of the bowl) and it will come together. Make sure all of the flour at the bottom of the bowl is incorporated.
Add 1 cup of the oatmeal and stir until well combined. Stir in the remaining oatmeal. Again, make sure all of the oats at the bottom of the bowl are incorporated into the dough.
Lastly, add the chips and toffee bits and stir until evenly distributed. It will be a stiff dough.
Scoop up the dough with a medium scooper (I use a #24 scoop which holds 2.7 tablespoons or 40ml) onto one of the prepared sheet pans, leaving 2 ½ -3 inches in between each scoop to allow for the cookies to spread.

Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes then scoop into 10-12 equal-size scoops. Roll each portion into a ball then roll in the cane (or granulated) sugar. At this point, the dough won’t be sticky and you can roll them into better-shaped balls before placing them on the prepared sheet pan. Place the dough balls about 2 inches apart to allow for a bit of expansion in the oven.
Bake for 17-20 minutes. The cookies won’t take on much color but the bottoms should be a nice golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.

In a medium size bowl stir the butter until creamy and smooth. Add the sugars and stir again until well combined. Add the egg and both extracts and stir again.
Next add the cocoa powder, corn starch and salt. Stir until completely incorporated.
Lastly, add the flour and stir, from the bottom up, scraping the sides of the bowl until the flour is mixed in and there are no white streaks. At first, it will seem like too much flour. Just keep going and suddenly it will all come together.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times to bring the dough together. Divide the dough in half.
Working with one half at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured surface, lifting it several times to another area to keep it floured underneath. If your rolling pin is sticking, you can lightly flour it but brush off any excess flour to avoid any white flour on the dark surface of the cookies.
Using a cutter of your choice, cut as many shapes as you can from the rolled out dough and transfer them to a prepared pan. At this point, you can place the cookies close together on the pan until after chilling them.
Re-roll scraps then repeat the rolling and cutting with the second portion of dough. Place the cutout cookies in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (longer is fine).
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes until slightly firm to the touch. Larger cookies will take a bit longer.
Transfer the baked cookies to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely before adding the almond buttercream.
While the cookies are cooling, make the almond buttercream.
Add the butter to a medium-large microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel or plastic wrap. Cook on high power for 1 minute or until melted.
Add the half and half and powdered sugar and whisk until creamy and smooth. Add the vanilla and ¼ teaspoon of the almond extract and stir again. Take a little taste and add more almond extract if desired.

Spray a 12 or 24-cup mini muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray. Wipe the inside of each cup with a paper towel to thoroughly coat. Set aside.
Place the soft butter in a medium-size bowl and stir to blend. Add the sugars and stir until well combined.
Add the egg yolks, vanilla and peppermint extracts, baking powder and the salt and stir again.
Next stir in the cocoa powder until completely incorporated. Lastly, add the flour. At first, it may seem like too much flour but keep stirring until all the white streaks are gone.
Scoop the dough into 28-34 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball with your hands. (I like to use a scale and make each portion around 30g or 1 ounce.)
Place about ¼ cup granulated or cane sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll each ball in the sugar then place it in the center of one of the cups of the prepared mini muffin pan.
With a small round measuring spoon (I use a half teaspoon spoon) make an indention in the center of each ball of dough.
Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are slightly firm to the touch. It’s better to underbake just a bit than to overbake.
Remove from the oven and reinforce the indentations with the same little measuring spoon. (At this point, you can make the indentations a little deeper to hold more of the delicious filling if you like.) 
Allow the cookies to cool for 10 minutes then remove the brownie bites to a cooling rack to cool completely. (I use a table knife to gently lift each cookie enough to be able to remove it from the pan.)
In a medium-size microwave-safe bowl, combine the white chocolate and butter. Cook on high power for 30-40 seconds until the butter is melted. Stir until the white chocolate is melted. You might need another 10-20 seconds in the microwave.
Add the half and half and extracts and stir again. Then add the powdered sugar and stir until nice and smooth. I like to use a whisk for this. You may need a little extra powdered sugar. You want a thick but pourable consistency.
Add a few drops of green food coloring to achieve a hue of green that you like (I add 4-5 drops, stirring after each drop until I like the color. 
Using a 1 teaspoon measuring spoon, fill each brownie indentation to the top.
Sprinkle with nonpareils (if desired) while the filling is still wet. I like to fill 3-4 cookies at a time, then sprinkle with the nonpareils so they stick to the filling.
Allow the filling to set. This will take 1-2 hours. If you want to speed things up, you can refrigerate the brownie bites for 30 minutes.

Place soft butter in a medium-size mixing bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula until nice and smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Mix together by hand for about 30 seconds until well blended.
Add the flour and cornstarch. Stir until dry ingredients are incorporated. The dough will be a little shaggy but will start to come together.
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and gather into a ball. Knead 5-6 times until smooth and all the small pieces are worked in. If the dough seems sticky, knead it again with a tablespoon or two of extra flour on your work surface. Form the dough into a ball again and flatten it with your hand to form a flat disk.
Turn the disk to coat both sides with flour. Roll out the dough to an approximate ¼-inch thickness (see Café Tips above in the post). Keep your work surface, dough and rolling pin lightly dusted with flour.
With a round cookie cutter, cut out circles then cut each one in half with a knife or dough scraper. Transfer the semicircles to the prepared pans with a thin, metal spatula. Re-roll scraps as many times as needed to use up the dough.
Place cutouts in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least one hour or up to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350˚F. Remove the cutouts from the refrigerator and bake for 12-18 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Repeat with the second pan of cutouts. Cool completely on a wire rack before icing.
Combine powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons half-and-half, vanilla extract and almond extract (if using) in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick, but pourable. Add a little more half-and-half if too thick. Add more powdered sugar if it’s too thin. (See the picture above in the post.)
Add a bit of pink gel food coloring (I use a toothpick) or a few drops of pink liquid food coloring and stir well to combine. Add more food color if needed to achieve the desired color.
Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little larger than your cookies).
Hold onto the edges of a cookie and dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surface touches the glaze. Pull the cookie straight up out of the glaze and allow the excess glaze to drip into the bowl for about 15-20 seconds. (You can gently shake the cookie back and forth and up and down to get it to drip a little faster.)
Then quickly flip the cookie to the right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface.
Repeat with the remaining cookies. Gently press 6-10 of the mini chocolate chips into the icing randomly or in a pattern.
Place cookies on a wire cooling rack to dry for at least 3-4 hours before adding the green (rind) icing.
See pictures and a video in the post above, demonstrating this Dip, Drip and Flip technique.
Combine powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons half-and-half and vanilla extract in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. This glaze should be a little thicker than the pink icing. Add a little more half-and-half if too thick. Add more powdered sugar if it’s too thin. (See a picture above in the post.)
Add a bit of green gel food coloring (I use a toothpick) or a few drops of green liquid food coloring and stir well to combine. Add more food color if needed to achieve the desired color.
Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little larger than your cookies).
Hold onto a cookie with one corner of the rounded edge facing down. Dip the rounded corner into the icing and slowly turn the cookie in the icing to coat the entire rounded edge with the green icing. See the pictures in the post above of this technique.
Pull the cookie up out of the glaze and allow the excess glaze to drip back into the bowl for about 15-20 seconds.
Run your finger along the back edge of the cookie several times to remove any excess icing then lay the cookie on a wire cooling rack to dry completely before storing in an airtight container.
I like to let these cookies sit out for 12-24 hours before layering or stacking them in an airtight container. If gifting these cookies, I also let them dry for 12-24 hours before stacking them between parchment paper in a gift box.

Brown Butter Blueberry Blondies,Chris Scheuer,5, 2 ,Dessert,American,Prep Time 25 minutes mins,Cook Time 25 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 50 minutes mins,NA,11,"Place the butter in a medium-large microwave-safe bowl and cover the bowl tightly with a piece of plastic wrap. Take a small sharp knife and cut 3-4 slits in the top for ventilation. (You can also cover the bowl with a plate if you prefer to avoid plastic wrap.)
Cook the butter on high power in the microwave for 4 minutes. Open the microwave and take a peek. You’re looking for a deep golden color. You will probably need more time (my microwave is 900W and it takes 5 minutes to perfectly brown butter). Continue cooking for 30-second increments and checking until you achieve that golden brown butter. (Once you figure out the time your microwave takes, you can just set the microwave for that in the future.) 
Remove from the microwave with a hot pad and carefully (it will be hot) remove the plastic wrap. Allow the brown butter to cool for 15 minutes while you preheat the oven, prepare the pan and get out the other ingredients.
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Spray an 8-by-8-inch square baking pan with baking spray, then line the pan foil, leaving a generous overhang on two sides. Spray the foil lightly with baking spray and rub to coat with a paper towel. Set aside.
Add the brown sugar to the cooled butter mixture and whisk until nice and smooth. Add the egg, vanilla and almond extract and whisk well. Sprinkle the baking powder and salt over the top and stir to combine.
Add the flour and stir with a sturdy silicone spatula or a wooden spoon until just combined. Stir in the white chocolate chips and ½ of the toffee bits. Gently fold in the blueberries, trying not to smush them too much.
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and gently spread and smooth with an offset spatula to even the surface. Sprinkle with the remaining toffee bits.
Tuck extra blueberries and white chips into the top, if desired

In a large mixing bowl, stir the very soft butter for 15-20 seconds until nice and smooth. Add the sugar and stir again for 30-45 seconds until creamy.
Add the vanilla, almond extract and salt and stir to combine then add the cornstarch and stir until well incorporated.
Finally, stir in the flour. The dough will be crumbly at first. Keep stirring, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough starts to come together.
Scoop up the dough into 2-tablespoon portions. Roll in the palm of your hands into balls and place on the prepared sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between the cookies.
Using your pointer or middle finger, gently make an indention in the center of each cookie, rotating your finger in a small circle to enlarge the opening.
Refrigerate the dough balls for at least an hour and up to 12 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
Remove the dough balls from the refrigerator. Fill each indentation with about ½ teaspoon jam. You can use a small spoon for this or a ziplock or disposable pastry bag. Spoon the jam into the bag then make a small snip off a corner of the ziplock bag (or off the bottom of a pastry bag) and squeeze the jam into the indentions.
Bake on the prepared sheet pan for 15-20 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown. The tops will still be fairly pale. Let the cookie cool on the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely before glazing.
Combine the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon of almond extract and 3 teaspoons of water in a small bowl or measuring cup. Stir with a fork or small whisk until combined. Add more water, ½ teaspoon at a time until the glaze will drizzle nicely when the fork or whisk is held up above the bowl. Taste and add more almond extract if desired.
Drizzle the glaze back and forth over the cooled cookies.
When serving, I like to add a small spoonful (about ¼ teaspoon or less) of extra jam to the center of each cookie (optional). A tiny herb sprig or edible flower also makes a pretty presentation.

Spray the foil (or parchment) with cooking spray. Set aside. Also spray a large pot or Dutch oven and a large spoon or spatula with cooking spray.
Heat the butter in the prepared pot over medium heat. After the butter melts it will start to sizzle a bit and a white foam will develop on the top. If it’s splattering too much reduce the heat a bit. Continue cooking for 3-5 minutes until the butter gets silent (stops sizzling) and the foam turns a deeper yellow. Start swirly the pan occasional at this point until the butter turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma.

Mix in the flour then the oats and stir to combine. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all of the dry ingredients are incorporated and there are no pockets of flour or oats. 
Lastly stir in the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and toffee bits. The dough will be stiff but keep working it until all the chips and bits are nicely distributed. Refrigerate the dough for 10-15 minutes. (This short chill time will help the dough from spreading a lot in the oven.)
Using a retractable scooper or a spoon, scoop up the cookies onto the prepared sheet pans. (I use a 3-tablespoon scoop for medium large cookies - you can go larger or smaller to your preference.)
Bake for 14-18 minutes or until medium golden brown.
Optional - Sometimes cookies will spread in the oven and get irregular in shape. I like to check these cookies at right around 12 minutes. If they’ve spread and/or aren’t nice and round, I use a metal spatula to push any irregular shaped cookies back into a nice round circle.

In a medium size bowl, combine the soft butter and sugar. Stir until smooth and well combined.
Add the egg yolks, vanilla extract and lemon zest. Stir to combine. Add the flour and stir until well incorporated and the dough starts to come together. The mixture will seem crumbly at first. Just keep stirring until it comes together.
Sprinkle a work surface with flour. Have some extra flour on the side in a small cup.
Turn the dough over several times to coat lightly with the flour then divide the dough in two and cover one half with a piece of plastic wrap.
Keeping the surface and your rolling pin lightly dusted with flour at all times, roll out the dough to the desired thickness. I like mine about a ¼ thick for thinner cookies and closer to ⅜ for thicker ones. You can go thinner or thicker it’s just important to keep the surface underneath the dough lightly floured as you roll. (I also like to dip my cookie cutter in flour before cutting each cookie to keep the dough from sticking to the cutter.)
Use a cutter of your choice (I used a scalloped 2.5-inch cutter) to cut out the cookies, transferring them to one of the prepared sheet pans as you go. Space the cookies 2 inches apart.
Bring the dough scraps together then roll out more cookies until the dough is used up. Repeat with second ball of dough. Chill the cookies in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking.
Bake the cookies for 12-16 minutes or until light golden brown. If the cookies have puffed a bit or have some little bubbles, you can flatten them at this point with the back of a flat metal spatula. Transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
Combine powdered sugar, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon half and half and vanilla extract in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick, but pourable. Add a little more half and half if too thick. Add more powdered sugar if it’s too thin. (See picture above in the post.)
Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little larger than your cookies). Slowly stir the glaze to release and air bubbles.
Holding onto the edges of one cookie, dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surface touches the glaze. Pull cookie straight up out of the glaze and allow excess glaze to drip into the bowl for about 15-20 seconds. (You can gently shake the cookie back and forth and up and down to get it to drip a little faster.) Then quickly flip the cookie to the right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. If the glaze drips over the edge of the cookie, you didn’t let it drip quite long enough.
Repeat the dip, drip and flip technique with the remaining cookies. Place cookies on a cooling rack and allow the glaze to dry for 20-30 minutes. If you want to stack the cookies in a storage container or box for gifting, you’ll need to let the glaze dry for at least 8 hours. I like to let them sit out overnight before stacking.

Place soft butter in a medium-size mixing bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula until nice and smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Mix together by hand for about 30 seconds, until fluffy and well blended.
Sprinkle the flour and cornstarch evenly over the top. Stir until flour is incorporated and the dough is shaggy. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and press dough in a ball. Knead a few times until fairly smooth then form into a ball again and press with your hands into a flat disk.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to a ⅜-inch thickness. Keep work surface, dough and rolling pin lightly dusted with flour. Cut circles and place on prepared pans. Re-roll scraps as many times as needed to use up the dough.
Place cutouts in the refrigerator for at least one hour or up to 24 hours.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350˚F. Remove cookies from refrigerator and bake for 12-16 minutes or until just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Rotate pans halfway through for even browning. Cool completely before icing.
Combine powdered sugar, half and half and ¼ teaspoon peppermint (or other flavored) extract in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be thick but pourable. Add a little more half and half if too thick. Taste the glaze and add more peppermint extract, if needed (see the note above in the post). 
Dip the tip of a small knife into the blue food coloring and swirl some of it into the icing. Stir well and add more food color until desired shade of blue is achieved. Transfer the glaze to a shallow bowl.
Holding onto the edges of a cookie, dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surfaces touch the glaze. Pull cookie up and out of the glaze. Allow excess glaze to drip back into a separate bowl. 
When the glaze stops dripping, quickly flip the cookie right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Repeat with remaining cookies. Allow glaze to dry for 15-30 minutes.
Place butter in a medium-size bowl and stir until smooth. Add powdered sugar, 1½ tablespoons of half and half and the mint extract and stir vigorously until smooth, adding a bit more half and half, if needed to achieve a fairly thick but spoonable consistency.
Place buttercream in a pastry bag fitted with a small round icing tip (I used a Wilton #3 round tip).

Refrigerate the dough for 10 minutes then proceed with step 4.
Scoop up the dough into 1-1½ tablespoon scoops and roll with the palms of your hands into balls. Place the balls on the prepared sheet pans, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Press gently on each cookie with the back of a fork to flatten just a bit. Sprinkle each cookie lightly with sugar. (I like to use cane sugar which is just slightly coarser than regular granulated sugar.)
Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cookies are a light golden brown at the edges. Remove from the oven and sprinkle lightly with a bit more sugar. Cool on the sheet pan for 1 minute then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before filling.
Combine the soft butter, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, half and half and 1 cups of the powdered sugar in a medium size bowl. Stir with a sturdy spatula or wooden spoon until well combined. Add the remaining powdered sugar and stir until nice and smooth. You want a smooth, spreadable icing. If it seems too thin, add a bit more powdered sugar. If it's too thick add more half and half, a few drops at a time.
Add 2 drops orange food color. Stir until well combined. Add more, one drop at a time, stirring well after each addition, until desired color is achieved. You can also use orange gel food color.

Spread a layer of the pumpkin buttercream on the flat side of half of the cookies, and then cover with the remaining cookies to make sandwiches. You can also place the buttercream in a pastry bag or ziplock bag. Snip a tiny corner off of the bag and pipe the buttercream onto the cookies.

Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead it a few times until it’s nice and smooth and no longer sticks to the work surface. Form the dough into a ball then divide the ball in half. Form each half into a round ball. Don’t be afraid to use more flour if the dough still seems sticky. Press each half with your hands to form a disc.

Sprinkle a work surface with flour. Have some extra flour on the side in a small cup.
Turn the dough over several times to coat lightly with the flour then divide the dough in two and cover one half with a piece of plastic wrap.
Keeping the surface and your rolling pin lightly dusted with flour at all times, roll out the dough to the desired thickness.

Spray the bottom and sides of a 9x9-inch square baking pan with non stick baking spray. Line the bottom and up two sides of the pan with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch overhanging at the top of the pan of each side. Lightly spray the parchment with baking spray and rub with a paper towel.
Combine the soft butter, sugar and vanilla in a medium-large bowl. Stir well with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to combine. Add the vanilla and salt and stir again.
Add the flour and stir until all the flour is incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. The dough will be crumbly, but all of the flour should be mixed in.
Spread the crumbs across the bottom of the prepared pan and press them into an even layer with lightly floured hands.
Bake on the middle rack for 22-25 minutes, or until light golden brown.
Transfer the pan to a cooling rack. Increase the oven temperature to 425°
Towards the end of the baking time, start making the caramel/almond topping. In a medium-size microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl, combine the cream, honey, vanilla and butter. Microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Set aside.
In a heavy medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar, water and corn syrup and water and bring to a boil over moderately high heat, stirring just to combine. Don’t stir after this.
Cook the syrup over moderately high heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until a medium amber caramel forms, about 8-10 minutes. (Watch the syrup carefully the last couple minutes, swirling the pan more frequently at this point to prevent burning). Remove from the heat.
Carefully add the honey/cream mixture (it will bubble furiously) and stir to combine. Return the pan to the burner and cook the caramel over moderately high heat, stirring frequently until a candy thermometer registers 255°, about 7-10 minutes. Stir in the almonds and immediately pour the caramel mixture over the shortbread, spreading to an even layer.
Return the pan to the oven and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the topping is bubbling all over and a nice deep golden brown. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if desired. Allow to cool completely before cutting. I like to allow at least 2 hours.

Spray two 12-cup mini muffin pans (or one 24-cup mini muffin pan) with baking spray. Rub each cup with a piece of paper toweling to make sure they’re thoroughly coated, including the top edges.
Place the soft butter and powdered sugar in a medium-size bowl and stir until smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and stir to combine. Sprinkle in the corn starch and stir until nice and smooth.
Add the flour and salt and stir, turning the bowl and stirring from the bottom up. At first, the dough will be very shaggy and dry, but after a minute or so it will come together nicely. Just keep stirring until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough comes together in a big clump.
Divide the dough into 24 equal portions. You can eyeball this or use a scale. I weigh the dough and then divide it by 24. It usually comes out to 25-26g each. Give each portion of dough a little squeeze and hold it in your hand for about 10 seconds (to compress and warm the dough a bit) then roll it between your palms into round balls.
Place each ball into one of the prepared mini muffin cups and flatten each one gently with your fingers. Using a ½ teaspoon measuring spoon (see the pictures above in the post), make an indention in the center of each flattened ball. (I like to do about 3 at a time: squeeze 3 portions, roll them into balls then make the wells. This keeps the dough from drying out and cracking when you make the little wells.) If the dough cracks at the edges, just push it together with your fingers while the spoon is still in the center.
Place the pan(s) in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes then remove the pan from the oven and reinforce the wells again with a half teaspoon measuring spoon. Bake for another 8-12 minutes or until the outer edges of each tart are a medium golden brown. Remove from the oven and immediately reinforce the center wells one last time, by pushing in with the ½ teaspoon measuring spoon. You can make the wells as shallow or deep as you’d like at this point.
Allow the tart shells to cool in the pan for 10 minutes then remove them from the pan by inserting a small sharp knife into the center of each shell and pulling upward. Cool completely on a cooling rack before filling.
Unwrap the caramels and place them in a small saucepan. Add the cream or half and half. Heat over medium-low heat until the caramels are melted. Stir well to create a creamy sauce.

Add the flour and cornstarch. Stir until dry ingredients are mostly incorporated. The dough will be a little shaggy.
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and gather into a ball. Knead 5-6 times until fairly smooth and all the small pieces are worked in. If the dough seems sticky, knead it again with a little more flour. Form into a ball again and flatten with your hand to form a flat disk.
Turn the disk to coat both sides with flour. Roll out the dough to an approximate ¼-inch thickness (see Café Tips above in the post). Keep work surface, dough and rolling pin lightly dusted with flour.
With a heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookies and transfer to them to the prepared pans with a thin, metal spatula. Re-roll scraps as many times as needed to use up the dough.
Place cutouts in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least one hour or up to 24 hours.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350˚F. Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Repeat with the second pan of cutouts. Cool on a wire rack before icing.
Combine powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons half and half and flavored extract in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick, but pourable. Add a little more half and half if too thick. Add more powdered sugar if it's too thin. (See picture above in the post.) Taste the glaze and add more extract, if a more intense flavor is desired.
Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little larger than your cookies). Add a drop of food color and stir well to combine. Add more food color if needed to achieve the desired color.
Hold onto the edges of a cookie and dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surface touches the glaze. Pull cookie straight up out of the glaze and allow excess glaze to drip into the bowl for about 15-20 seconds. (You can gently shake the cookie back and forth and up and down to get it to drip a little faster.)
Then quickly flip the cookie to the right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Sprinkle cookies on one side with colored nonpareils.
Repeat with remaining cookies. Place cookies on a cooling rack and allow the glaze to dry for 20-30 minutes.

Whisk in the eggs and vanilla until the mixture is creamy and fluffy.
Sprinkle the baking soda, baking powder and salt evenly over the top of the butter mixture and stir to combine. Add the flour and stir with a sturdy spatula until all of the flour is incorporated, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl frequently. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lick the spatula and bowl clean, but be sure to wash your face before your mother shows up.
Scoop up the dough in 2 tablespoon scoops onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Don't worry about spacing the cookies at this point. You can crowd them so you don't have to refrigerate several pans. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 72 hours, covered lightly with plastic wrap.
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350˚F. Line several sheet pans with parchment paper. Place refrigerated dough balls onto one of the sheet pans, spacing 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. (Keep the rest refrigerated.)
Bake until golden brown but still soft, 14-18 minutes or until golden brown. Add additional chocolate chips to the tops of the cookies, if desired and sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt (optional).

Add the baking powder and salt and stir to combine. Lastly, add the flour and stir until it’s completely incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill for one hour. 
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper for easy cleanup. 
Scoop up the dough into 1½-3 tablespoon scoops. Roll the scoops into balls and place about 2 inches apart on the prepared sheet pan. With a flat bottom glass, press each dough ball down to create a ½-inch tall cookie. I like to place a small piece of parchment paper on top of the dough ball before pressing to flatten it. The parchment will keep the dough from sticking to the bottom of the glass.
Bake for 12-16 minutes or until the cookies are just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Don’t overbake. 
Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. 
While the cookies are cooling make the icing by combining the soft butter, powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of the half and half and extracts in a medium-size bowl. Stir together until creamy and well combined. If icing is stiff add more half and half, a teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. You want a thick, but nicely spreadable consistency. Add 2-4 drops of green food coloring to get a pretty green color
To frost the cookies, spread each cookie with a generous spoonful of frosting and spread to just within the edges of the cookies. You can also use a piping bag with a large round tip. Pipe the icing, starting in the center and working your way to near the edges. Then use a small offset knife to spread the icing with a circular motion. Sprinkle the cookies with Christmasy nonpareils right away, before the icing dries. Allow the icing to set for about 30 minutes.

Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line with parchment paper. Set aside.
Separate egg whites from the yolks and beat the whites with a fork or small whisk vigorously for 45 seconds until nice and frothy (they won’t be stiff or have peaks, just nice and frothy). Discard or use the yolks for another recipe.
Combine the almond flour, sugar, powdered sugar and salt in a medium-size bowl and stir well with a fork to combine. Drizzle the vanilla and almond extract over the mixture and again stir until well combined.
Drizzle 4 tablespoons of the frothy egg white over the almond meal mixture. Stir with a fork until the mixture is uniformly crumbly. Slowly add more egg white, a little at a time, just until all of the almond flour is incorporated. You may have some egg white left over. The dough should be thick but smooth.
Scoop the dough by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared pans. I like to use a 1½-tablespoon cookie scoop and level it nice and flat. You should have about 24-28 cookies.
Either lightly wet your fingers or dip them in powder sugar and dimple the tops of each mound of dough by pressing in with three fingers lightly. (I use my thumb, forefinger and middle fingers together.)

Red White and Blue Glazed Shortbread Cookies,Chris Scheuer,5, 12 ,Dessert/Cookies,American,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13,"Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
Place soft butter in a medium-size mixing bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula until nice and smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Mix together by hand for about 30 seconds, until fluffy and well blended.
Sprinkle the flour and cornstarch evenly over the top. Stir until flour is incorporated and the dough is shaggy.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and press dough in a ball. Knead a few times until smooth, then form into a ball again and press with your hands into a flat disk.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to a ⅜-inch thickness. Keep work surface, dough and rolling pin lightly dusted with flour. Cut out cookies and place on prepared pans. Re-roll scraps as many times as needed to use up the dough.
Place cutouts in the refrigerator for at least one hour or up to 24 hours.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350˚F. Remove cookies from the refrigerator and bake for 12-16 minutes or until just beginning to turn golden at the edges. Rotate pans halfway through for even browning. Cool completely before glazing.
Combine powdered sugar, half and half and ¼ teaspoon lemon (or your favorite flavor) extract in a medium-size bowl. Mix until smooth. The glaze should be thick but pourable. Add a little more half and half if too thick. Taste the glaze and add more extract, if needed (see the ​note above in the post).
Transfer half of the glaze to a small bowl. With a toothpick, add a small amount of red and blue gel food coloring and swirl it just a bit. Don’t swirl too much or the icing will become murky. Use a light hand with the gel food coloring. A little goes a long way!
Dip one cookie at a time into the glaze. Let the cookie sit on the top of the glaze and gently push down at all the edges to ensure the surface of the cookie is covered with the glaze. With your thumb and forefinger, pull the cookie out of the glaze and allow the excess icing to drip off into a separate bowl. Then quickly flip the cookie right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Repeat with remaining cookies. (See video above for a demonstration of this technique>)
Add more of the white glaze to the bowl when needed. Repeat adding more gel coloring as needed.
Sprinkle with red, white and blue sprinkles (or other colors) while wet, if desired.
Allow the cookies to dry on a wire rack for at least 2 hours after glazing, then store in an airtight container.",9,"8 ounces very soft butter, (2 sticks)",½ cup powdered sugar,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour,¼ cup cornstarch,2 cups powdered sugar,"2 tablespoons half and half or milk, maybe more",2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice,"red, white and blue sprinkles, optional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Cafe Sucre Farine,https://thecafesucrefarine.com/red-white-and-blue-glazed-shortbread-cookies/,NA,NA,NA

Combine soft butter, sugars, vanilla and salt in a medium-large bowl. Stir for about 30 seconds until nice and creamy.
Add the flour and cornstarch. Stir with a sturdy spatula or wooden spoon until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough starts to come together. Stir in the chocolate chips and mix until the chips are evenly incorporated.
Press the dough firmly into the prepared pan to create an even surface. If the dough is sticking to your fingers, dip your hand in flour from time to time. Sprinkle with the Demerara sugar.
If using a tart pan with a removable bottom, place it on the prepared sheet pan (sometimes a little butter may leak out) and place the sheet pan on the center oven rack. If using a round cake pan, place it right on the center rack. Bake for 25-35 minutes until nicely golden brown. Check frequently towards the end of baking time. You want it to be a pretty golden brown but not overbaked.

Transfer the icing to a shallow bowl. Add 3-4 of the shortbread bites to the bowl and spoon the icing over each one to completely coat.

Transfer the glaze to a small shallow bowl (a little bigger than your cookies). With a toothpick, swirl a small amount of two green gel food colorings through the icing in the bowl.  Don’t swirl too much or the icing will become a solid color. Use a light hand with the gel food coloring. A little goes a long way!
To glaze the cookies, hold onto the edge of a cookie and dip the top surface into the glaze, being sure all of the surface touches the glaze. Pull cookie straight up and out of the glaze. Allow excess glaze to drip into another bowl or plate (this will keep the glaze from getting murky) for about 30 seconds. When glaze stops dripping, quickly flip the cookie to the right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Repeat with remaining cookies.

Beat softened butter in the bowl of an electric mixer until soft and fluffy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until smooth.
Add flour and salt. Beat just until all flour is incorporated. Make sure there’s not dry flour at the bottom of the bowl.
Place dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a disk. Wrap well and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes. (If you end up refrigerating more than 15 minutes, let dough sit out and warm up a bit before rolling. Otherwise it will crack when you try to roll it.)
Remove dough and unwrap. On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough into a ¼ inch (.6 cm) thick circle. I like to use ⅜ or ¼-inch dowels on either side of my dough as I roll it (pictured above in the post, the ¼ inch will be thinner). This keeps the dough at a perfect even thickness.
Cut into rounds or other shapes using a lightly floured cookie cutter. Place on the prepared baking sheets and place in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. (This will firm up the dough so the cookies will maintain their shape better when baked.) Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until cookies are lightly browned at the edges. If your oven does not bake evenly, exchange the pans on the racks half way through baking time. Cool cookies on a wire rack.
Shortbread cookies with keep in an airtight container for about a week or they can be frozen.
To make the glaze, combine powdered sugar, vanilla, almond extract and 3 tablespoons of the milk in a medium large bowl. Mix well and add more milk, one teaspoon at a time until a thick but drizzle-able glaze is formed. Transfer half of the glaze to a small bowl (like a soup size bowl). With a toothpick, add a small amount of gel food coloring and stir all through the icing in circular movements to form a swirly pattern. Don’t stir too much or the icing will become a solid color. Use a light hand with the gel food coloring. A little goes a long way!
Dip one cookie at a time into the glaze. Let the cookie sit on the top of the glaze and gently push down at all the edges to ensure the surface of the cookie is covered with the glaze. With your thumb and forefinger, pull the cookie out of the glaze and allow the excess icing to drip off. Then quickly flip the cookie right side up and give it a gentle jiggle to allow the glaze to flow evenly over the surface. Repeat with remaining cookies. Add more of the white glaze to the bowl when needed (stir well before adding). Use a toothpick to swirl more food coloring through the glaze any time the swirly effect is getting lost. You may need to add a few more drops of milk if the glaze gets too thick. Just stir it in well and add a little more food coloring to restore the swirly effect.
Allow the cookies to sit on a wire rack for a least one hour to “set” the icing. Once the icing is set, cookies can be stacked in an airtight container with wax paper or parchment paper between the layers.",12,For the cookies:,"1 cup butter, softened",½ cup powdered sugar,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,2 cups all-purpose flour,¼ teaspoon salt,For the glaze:,2 cups powdered sugar,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,½ teaspoon almond extract,"4 tablespoons milk, maybe a little more",gel food coloring,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,The Cafe Sucre Farine,https://thecafesucrefarine.com/glazed-shortbread-cutout-cookies/,NA,NA,NA

Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl (2 quart size is perfect. I use this one almost daily). Microwave on high power for 20-30 seconds or until butter is starting to melt and has become soft. Don’t let it melt completely, as the dough will be runny and the cookies will not have a good texture. (see picture in post)
Add sugars and mix with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula until smooth and all brown sugar lumps are dissolved. Add vanilla and egg yolks, then stir again until smooth.
Add the flour and sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the top. Stir just until all flour mixture is incorporated and dough pulls away from sides of bowl. See “Tips” at the end of the post and picture in post.

Place in oven for 20-25 minutes or until mixture begins to turn golden, stirring well every five minutes to redistribute. Remove from oven andallow to cool for 5 minutes. Reduce temperature to 250˚F.
While nuts and seeds are toasting, combine cherries, 2 tablespoons rice syrup, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, cinnamon salt and vanilla in the bowl of a food processor. Process for 1 minute or until mixture is fairly smooth.
Combine toasted nut/seed mixture and cherry mixture from food processor in a large bowl. Stir with a large spatula to combine. Cherry mixture will be thick, so you'll need to work it into the nut/seed mixture. Keep stirring and working the cherry mixture in until there are no large chunks left. This will take several minutes and will be easier if you don't let the nuts cool down too much. I like to put my bowl in my sink as it's much easier for me to stir it and work the cherry mixture in from above. These silicone spatulas with wooden handles are some of my favorite kitchen tools. They're inexpensive, sturdy and you don't have to worry about the handles melting if resting on a hot pot.

Chocolate Chewy Meringue Cookies,Chris Scheuer,4.20, 5 ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Heat oven to 350˚F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper lightly with cooking spray.
Mix sugar, cocoa, and salt in a bowl. Stir in chocolate chips. Add egg whites and vanilla; beat with a fork or electric mixer on medium until batter is just moistened.
(Do not overbeat batter or it will stiffen.)
Drop batter by teaspoonful onto baking sheets in evenly spaced mounds. Bake cookies until tops are lightly cracked and glossy, about 15 minutes.
Leave the cookies on the paper-lined sheet pans until they are cool, then remove with a metal spatula to a storage container.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Austrian Raspberry Blueberry Shortbread,Chris Scheuer,4, 1 ,Dessert,Austrian,Prep Time 20 minutes mins,Cook Time 40 minutes mins,NA,Total Time 1 hour hr,NA,10,"Cream the butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer) until soft and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and mix well.
Add the ¾ cup granulated sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt to the butter mixture and mix just until incorporated and the dough starts to come together.
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and form into two balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and freeze at least 2 hours or overnight (or as long as a month, if you like).
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350˚F. Lightly grease an 8x8 or 9x9 square baking pan or a 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom. (I use Baker's Joy spray)
Remove one ball of dough from the freezer and coarsely grate it by hand or with the grating disk in a food processor into the bottom of the prepared pan. Make sure the surface is covered evenly with shreds of dough.
Gently mix the blueberries, raspberries and the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Mix the 2 tablespoons of sugar, flour, lemon zest in a small bowl until combined, then add to blueberry/raspberry mixture and mix gently with your hand to coat the berries with the flour mixture.
Cover the bottom layer of dough with the blueberry mixture as evenly as possible, gently pressing the berries into the dough. Remove the remaining dough from the freezer and coarsely grate it over the entire surface. (I grate this second ball of dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, then sprinkle over the berries.)
Place in oven and cover lightly with foil, bake for 20 minutes, then remove foil. Continue baking until lightly golden brown and the center no longer wiggles, about 20-30 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
After the shortbread is cooled, sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired or drizzle with lemon glaze. For lemon glaze, mix ½ cup powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add enough milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, to thin out to a thick drizzling consistency.
Cool on a wire rack then cut right in the pan with a serrated knife. Chilling the pan in the fridge makes it a lot easier to get clean cuts.",14,"7 ounces butter, 14 tablespoons, slightly softened",2 egg yolks,¾ cup granulated sugar,2 cups all-purpose flour,1 teaspoons baking powder,½ teaspoon salt,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,1 cup fresh blueberries,½ cup fresh raspberries,zest of 1 lemon,1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,2 tablespoons all-purpose flour,2 tablespoons sugar,"confectioners’ sugar, for dusting",NA,NA,NA,The Cafe Sucre Farine,https://thecafesucrefarine.com/austrian-raspberry-blueberry-shortbread/,NA,NA,NA
