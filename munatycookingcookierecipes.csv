Do not knead the dough, just work on gathering the dough from side to side. Kneading the dough will result in tough cookies.
No worries the dough will look super sticky and you might think that it failed, it is supposed to look like that at this stage. And to make sure that your dough didn’t fail, take a bout two tablespoon from it and lightly roll it between your palms to form a ball, you will see that the ball is formed, and it is not as sticky as it looks. (Magic)!
Cover the dough and refrigerate for 50 minutes to an hour.
Take half of the dough and roll it into a 12- to 13-inch-long log. Press it down horizontally and then vertically to help in spreading it evenly.
Take half of the date filling and roll it into a 12- to 13-inch-long log. Place the date filling at the edge of the dough (the side close to you).
Roll the dough up just like when rolling up cinnamon rolls. Cut the log in half and roll it up and down gently just to smooth the surface.
*It’s best to do this step after filling the dough with the dates and rolling it into a log.
In a plate, add the sesame seeds, then to it add the sugar and honey. Mix for a minute, you will feel that the mixture is sticky and heavy. Now add the water and mix for a few seconds, the mixture will now feel much lighter in weight.
Spread it on a large baking sheet.
Now gently roll the on the sesame coating. Careful not to make a thick coating, but if you did, you can remove the access with a pastry or silicon brush. (Do not forget to repeat the previous steps with the remaining half of the dough and filling)!
Cut the log into 2-inch cookies, you can cut it in an angle as shown in the video. To make the cutting easier place the logs in the fridge for 20 minutes and then cut the cookies.
Place the cookies in a lined baking sheet and bake in a preheated oven of 200C/392F for 12 minutes.

Cover and refrigerate for 30 to 35 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix the sugar with water and honey, mix well. Take out the dough from the fridge and pour the sugar mixture over it.
Do not knead the dough but work on gathering the dough together until it absorbs the liquid. The dough will feel like it won’t come together but it will. You will get a soft dough that will not stick much to your hand as shown in the video. Kneading the dough will make the barazek tough.
Cover the dough and refrigerate again for 30 to 40 minutes.
Mix the sesame seeds with honey and sugar. Keep mixing for a minute the mixture will feel heavy and sticky. Add the water and mix for a few seconds and the mixture will turn light, now it is ready to coat the barazek. Spread the sesame on a wide plate.
Add the crushed pistachios on a plat.
Form a small ball, place the ball on the pistachios and press lightly to make some of the pistachios stick to the bottom of the ball.
Remove the ball from the crushed pistachio plate, flip the ball and place it over the sesame mixture. Press down the ball to flatten it forming a thin disc, this will also make the sesame stick to the cookie.
Place the cookies sesame side up on a lined baking sheet, keeping an inch between each cookie. The cookies won't spread but just to be on the safe side it's best to leave an inch between each cookie.
Bake the cookies in a preheated oven of 170C – 338F for 15 to 18 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies is light brown.

The Best Kahk (Eid Cookies) Ever – Easy Recipe,Muna Kenny,18/04/2022,NA,NA,Middle Eastern Recipes,Arabian,Cookies,20 minutes,30 minutes,NA,50 minutes,7 people,20,"While the heat is off, add the water, sugar, corn flour, and honey to a saucepan. Mix well.
Turn on the heat to medium-high and stir occasionally. When the mixture is thick, reduce the heat to the lowest, pour in the lemon juice, and stir.
Keep on stirring the mixture occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
The process will take around an hour and 10 minutes or until you run a spatula in the middle of the pan to make a line, the line should remain visible as shown in the video.
Grease and dust a 7-inch pan with cornflour, then pour the malban. Spray the surface lightly with oil and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon.
Sprinkle the malban with cornflour and then tap it to prevent the surface from having cracks with your hand.
When it comes to room temperature, cover it, place it in the fridge to become firmer, and then cut it into small cubes.
Press the malban cube in your hand and then roll it into a ball. You can also press down the malban and mix it with the crushed pistachios and then roll it in your hand to form a ball. If the malban sticks to your hand, dust it with cornflour and continue creating small balls.
*Please note that you will have leftover malban, you can use it to make more cookies, or you can only make half the recipe. At home, we enjoy mixing malban with nuts and have it with Arabic coffee.
Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the ghee until light in color and fluffy. This will result in airy cookies.
Add the kahk spice (Read note #1 for subs), toasted sesame seeds, salt, sugar, yeast, and baking powder to the ghee and beat until combined.
It is best to sift the flour before using it to make the kahk. Add the flour to the ghee and beat for 4 to 5 minutes. This step will prevent the kahk from breaking while baking and have the right texture.
Pour the ¼ cup of water into the dough and mix until combined for a few seconds; you shouldn’t knead the dough for longer than a few seconds after adding the water, or the cookies will come out hard. Do not worry if the dough looks too soft after adding the water; it will get firmer while mixing.
Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes (do not refrigerate it).
Form 31 grams balls from the rested dough, press one ball between your palms, and if you see no cracks, it means that the dough is perfect.
Flatten each ball and fill it with the malban balls we created earlier close the ball and place it on a lined baking sheet. Press each ball down gently. Leave around 2 inches to 3 inches space between each kahk.
If your kitchen is hot and the balls are turning softer, refrigerate the filled balls for 10 minutes before baking.
Place the baking sheet in a preheated oven 180C – 350F on the middle shelf for 18 to 20 minutes.
Leave the khak on the baking sheet to cool completely. Moving the cookies while warm or hot will break them.

Add the sugar to the beaten eggs and beat until well combined, will take three minutes to four.
Now add the vanilla or any flavoring you wish to replace the vanilla with, like orange or lemon zest. Beat the mixture for a minute.
Sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. It is essential to sift the dry ingredients to prevent any lumps from the baking powder.
Add the flour to the beaten eggs and sugar. Mix until combined, and if you see small lumps in the batter at this stage, do not panic; it will disappear after adding the melted butter.
Pour the melted butter into the batter and mix until combined. Make sure the melted butter is not hot when adding it!
Cover the batter and refrigerate for 1 hour but best to chill for 2 hours to 12 hours. You can also place the covered batter in the freezer for a few minutes if you don’t want to wait for 2 hours. Read more in the notes below.
Preheat the oven to 350F/180C for at least 20 minutes before using it.
Prepare the pan. If you use a regular pan or a nonstick one, it is best to grease and flour it. A pastry brush will help a lot in this step, so brush the pan with butter and then dust it with flour. Make sure to use enough flour to cover the shell shape properly. Flip the pan over the working surface, or better do this at the sink. Tap the pan one time over the working surface or the sink to get rid of excess flour.
Do not mix the batter after taking it out of the fridge. Using an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, scoop the batter in the center of the madeleine’s molds. Do not try to spread the batter.
If using a silicone mold, place it over a baking sheet and then bake it in the oven.
Bake on the middle shelf for 12 minutes, or until you insert a toothpick in the middle of the madeleine and if it comes out clean.
